Learning they have mutual friends, Darcy invites the Gardiners and their nieces to stay for his house party. Elizabeth Bennet’s wit and vivacity make a favorable impression on Darcy, and she is equally impressed with his kindness and generosity.Mr. Darcy expects the rest of the Bennets will be as well-mannered and genteel. Instead, they are loud, vulgar, and rude. What’s worse, the youngest sister has eloped with Mr. Darcy’s nemesis!Still, Darcy believes if he can swallow his pride and ask Elizabeth to marry him, she will certainly accept. He did not anticipate her also having a sense of pride…Elizabeth knows her family is far from perfect, but to be told she’s loved despite their faults is an outrage. Darcy’s degrading proposal convinces her that she was sorely mistaken about his character.Can Darcy regain Elizabeth’s good opinion after such favorable impressions have been utterly dashed? Or will his charming cousin steal her heart?A clean, Regency-era romance with low angst and a HEA.

She is the author of several stories inspired by Jane Austen, including Not In Want of a Wife, Elizabeth’s Secret Admirer, and Marriage and Ministry. Prior to becoming an author, Amanda enjoyed a successful career as a professional harpist, and danced ballet for twenty years. When she’s not diving into the realm of her imagination, Amanda lives out her own happily ever after in Texas with her husband and three children"," 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars. This story ended at page 315 on my Kindle.Darcy and Elizabeth do not meet at the Meryton Assembly. (Although Bingley has leased Netherfield and then ""abandoned"" Jane as in canon.) Jane and Elizabeth tour Pemberley while on a trip with the Gardiners. When Darcy then returns home and finds them there they find that among his party, who will arrive later, are friends of the Gardiners, and, of course, the Bingley party. Darcy invites them to stay at Pemberley and it looks as if the romance for ODC will be without a hitch...wrong!Darcy joins Bingley and his family at Netherfield and upon meeting the rest of the Bennets begins to question if he can marry Elizabeth. But then Darcy bungles his proposal...much like canon! Wickham and Lydia play their part and, of course, we hear from Lady Catherine.This author used many of JA's words but maybe not always in the exact same situation. As someone else said in their review the language doesn't always flow smoothly.There were few surprises and, really, little angst for me. There are a few changes but a happy ending was always in view. "," Nice lower angst story. Would have been 5 stars, but I can't fathom Darcy stringing Caroline along and accepting her attentions so blatantly, nor Lady C encouraging the match. There would be many ladies infinitely more fitting for being the mistress of Pemberley. Caroline, even here, showed no inclination to managing or living at a country estate, only wanting the social position and prestige. Still, she deserves better than who she ended up with though I can see that she wouldn't really be put off with what was expected behavior back them. I did like the tempering of Lady C's personality once she no longer had Anne to marry off. "," What starts out beautifully ends with an awful proposal.  Can the wish to get along with his Aunt  Catherine  lead Darcy in the wrong direction? Or will things eventually bring him back to where he's always wanted to be, beside the one he truly loves?  We'll meet new friends and a new  relative of Mr. Darcy, and they won't all be who they should. We'll  also see Miss Bingley in  rare form. You'll probably find yourself holding your breath in  anticipation of what comes next, but  just hold on. It's well worth the wait.  Enjoy! "," This variation starts out wonderful, passes through sad, becomes ridiculous, then ends back at wonderful! I was completely enthralled from the beginning. "," This story is OK but nothing very interesting occurs. Definitely low angst. It just didn't click with me. I didn't feel for the characters as I normally do. "," Three and a half stars rounded up to four. ODC spend a lot of time apart. And Darcy seriously considering and flirting with Caroline Bingley??? He lets her feed him a grape! And Elizabeth blatantly flirting with a known rake??? Just NO!!!In this variation the Bingleys have already leased Netherfield (without Darcy) and abandoned the property leaving Jane broken hearted. The Bennets and Darcys have not met.Elizabeth and Jane are traveling to Derbyshire with the Gardiners and stop to tour Pemberley on their way to  Lambton. After the tour they meet Darcy just arriving in advance of a house party. When he discovers the Gardiners know some of his guests and that Elizabeth and Jane are acquainted with the Bingleys, he invites them to stay at Pemberley. Both Darcy and Elizabeth are attracted and Darcy makes a good impression on her and the Gardiners.Bingley wants to marry Jane and returns to Hertfordshire with the Gardiner party. Darcy will be best man so he follows them to stay at Netherfield. Now he meets the Bennets. They are even more uncouth than in canon and the estate is unkempt with a leaky roof. (Think Beverly Hillbillies without the nice house). Darcy is doing his best to tolerate Elizabeth’s family as he falls further and further under her spell. He appears to be ready to bury his scruples for the sake of love but Lydia’s sudden elopement is a bridge too far. He does scruple to anonymously assist Lydia (with the Gardiners knowledge) but then washes his hands of all things Bennet, including Elizabeth.Then Elizabeth visits Charlotte in Kent and Darcy is, once more, thrown back into her company. He just can’t resist and eventually breaks down and proposes. At first Elizabeth is thrilled until Darcy begins to insult her family. (I really couldn’t blame him!) Elizabeth gives him a set down and the relationship is over. In this version Anne de Bourgh is in the process of dying and Lady Catherine is more a beloved relation (but still as officious as ever). After Anne dies she is invited to live with the Darcys.Mrs Bennet talks Bingley into giving her three daughters a season in London and once again Darcy and Elizabeth are forced into company. Here is where both Darcy and Elizabeth choose bad company in order to prove to each other that they don’t care. Georgiana and Kitty meet the men they will marry (who are brothers) and some hilarity ensues with both Mrs Bennet and Lady Catherine at odds trying to plan a double wedding.Eventually the Bingleys return to Pemberley bringing Elizabeth with them. At last some sanity takes hold and ODC are reconciled. "

If anyone ever discovered that Miss Elizabeth Bennet had received a letter from a single gentleman, she could be ruined... or forced to marry a man she detests. In this Pride & Prejudice variation, Elizabeth takes the safer course and refuses to read Mr. Darcy's letter of explanation. Returning home unaware of Wickham's true nature, Elizabeth confesses everything to him, putting both Mr. Darcy and herself in grave danger from Wickham's schemes. Note: This book contains an intimate scene between an engaged couple.Although the cover is new, the rest of the book is unchanged.Praise for Abigail Reynolds' Pride & Prejudice Variations: ""Readers who can't get enough of Darcy and Elizabeth will find that Reynolds does an admirable job of capturing the feeling of the period in this entertaining diversion"" - BOOKLIST ""For those who have been chomping at the bit for another Reynolds' novel, Mr. Darcy's Obsession does not disappoint!"" - AUSTENPROSE ""It was a delight to once again experience Ms. Reynolds' enthralling prose, faithful yet emotive characterization, and tension-filled plots."" - AUSTENESQUE REVIEWS  Read more","Abigail Reynolds may be a nationally bestselling author and a physician, but she can't follow a straight line with a ruler. Originally from upstate New York, she studied Russian and theater at Bryn Mawr College and marine biology at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. After a stint in performing arts administration, she decided to attend medical school, and took up writing as a way to retain her sanity during her years as a physician in private practice.A life-long lover of Jane Austen's novels, Abigail began writing variations on Pride &amp; Prejudice in 2001, then expanded her repertoire to include a series of novels set on her beloved Cape Cod. Her most recent releases are A Matter of Honor, Mr. Darcy's Enchantment, Conceit &amp; Concealment, and Mr. Darcy's Journey. Her books have been translated into six languages. A lifetime member of the Jane Austen Society of North America, she lives on Cape Cod with her husband, her son and a menagerie of animals. Her hobbies do not include sleeping or cleaning her house."," Another intriguing 'what if' from this author's clever and poignant arsenal of Pride & Prejudice variations.  What if Elizabeth Bennet never read Mr. Darcy's letter?Yes, I was very curious to know how the dominoes would tumble over that one.  And, because I felt such excitement over that question and it is, of course, the beginning of this new plot trail, I hesitate to address the summary so I don't spoil the story.  She doesn't read the letter so she goes home with her perspective unchanged- and how does this alter the events in the story?Let's just say that I was both satisfied with some matters and a tad let down with others.  I was looking for a larger deviation as a result, I guess.  But, I did love seeing how the romance still manages to progress.  Darcy is quite the dashing, loyal and persistent lover in spite of greater challenges and a more beguiling Wickham.  Now, that said, he pretty much had to be all those things because if it could be misunderstood or misconstrued or not even communicated about then this Darcy and Lizzy were the champs at jumping to conclusions- particularly Lizzy.  I have to say that probably fifty pages of this book wouldn't exist if she'd just stop jumping to conclusions.  Gossip in the newspaper... oh, that must be gospel truth even though he's standing there trying to tell her that circumstances weren't what they appeared and he's suddenly turned into a liar and a rake.  Argh!And, while I'm on the subject, Bingley's wishy-washy action was annoying, too.  Oh, I get the validity of the argument that is explored more deeply here- can he really marry Jane Bennet and still have his family accepted into polite society?  Is it enough to conquer the taint of his money and position coming from trade?  But seeing him approach her, leave, approach her, leave, and... approach her, leave, approach her.  Man up, guy!I will say that one of the most delightful surprises in this book was the addition of a character the author created- another Wickham!  Truly, he was probably my favorite part.  What if George Wickham had a dashing relation to give him a run for his money in the charm and looks department?  Well... he does in this one.So, while some aspects were merely meh, other elements held some real sparkle and shine.  I can't praise this author's creative variation work enough. "," Elizabeth burns Darcy's letter without reading it and carries a grudge against him a bit longer. Rather indiscreetly, she informs Wickham of Darcy's proposal, and Wickham starts to walk back of his earlier slander of Darcy, trying to persuade Elizabeth to reconsider her refusal, no doubt thinking about how he could use a connection with Darcy's wife. Later she meets Darcy et al at Pemberley. Darcy finds out that she didn't read the letter and blurts out the real scoop about Wickham. Miss Bingley is her usual snippy self and Lydia elopes in her usual manner. Darcy arranges for her to marry Wickham's brother Thomas who is just as good in flattery but somewhat more palatable character otherwise.This was a pleasant read with the author's usual quality writing but this is one of those variations in which Elizabeth and Darcy constantly misunderstand each other and when Elizabeth gets hurt she tries to shut him out entirely without listening to him, and it sometimes gets a little tiresome because it's so predictable. Oh look, things are going well, quick,  it's Lizzy's turn to assume the worst of him now. Bingley decamps on Jane twice and still gets the girl. Poor Jane. "," Well, after reading all 85 other reviews I have several things to say to all who read reviews. Yes, Abigail Reynolds is one of the best in the JAFF genre. (She is my favorite.)  And in coming up with one story after another, I know she is going to have to become very inventive with events in the P&P story line.  And that is why I read her stories.  I have every one of her stories, this one in both paperback and kindle and I paid full price for the paperback.  Yes, she does have a seeming contradiction in that Lizzie would not read Darcy's letter but then she is alone with him and engages in sex.  Let us consider: she is ""not yet one-and-twenty"" and he is, what? seven-and-twenty.  I have no misgivings that through the generations, no matter what the conventions of society are, human bodies have the same urges.  Just because I am now a grandmother does not mean that I don't remember how strong those urges were (and how glorious).  No generation was exempt.  So my only problem with this scene is that they didn't lock the door! (But they were caught up in the moment, I guess, and who has their head on straight when they have waited 27 years to find love? LOL) Hard to imagine that they were not afraid of Georgina, much less the servants, walking in on them.I found the twists very griping: oh, Bingley, can't you see past worrying about Caroline?  Louisa is already married.  I liked that Wickham had a different consequence and that Darcy actually fought a duel with him.  And another brother who marries Lydia - great.  Liked being in his head when he thinks that Darcy is snubbing him (and Lydia) in not inviting them to the wedding.I read this novel just after it was published but have now re-read the complete novel so that I could post a review.  (Sometimes I only read the ""good"" parts and by that I do NOT mean the sex scenes.  I like angst and sexual tension the best.)  I always look for the next Abigail Reynolds book to come out. "

It's a change from canon, with exaggerations to some characters, so the emotional dynamics are quite different. Wosedwew's 5 star review dated June 9, 2020 gives an excellent summary of the story line.For me the only flaws were minor but notable. Elizabeth spends most of the story waffling about her love for Darcy and Darcy's love for her, so this got a bit tiresome towards the final chapters. Elizabeth's angsty indecision was in sharp contrast to Jane's stronger reactions and Anne's decisive strategizing, so it made her feel like a weak character. Granted she's somewhat adrift after realizing how badly she's misjudged Darcy and Wickham, but still......Elizabeth came off overall not feeling very Austen-like, despite a few flashes of witty comments.In fairness I will note that Elizabeth's insecurity about being loved plays into the rewrite of Mrs. Bennet. In this story she is actively dismissive of her second daughter, praising only Jane and Lydia. Her bias towards the youngest Bennet has Mrs. B actually disowning Elizabeth. Fortunately, her father at last emerges from his lethargy during the crisis with Lydia, and Elizabeth gratefully receives his support when she is threatened with scandal.The second negative was that Darcy was so completely oblivious about the effects of his actions (and non-actions) upon Elizabeth and others, it made him look quite foolish. It's one thing to not care about the opinions of others, but it's another thing altogether to be totally BLIND to how people are going to react to you.A new character, Lady Arabella Winslow, is introduced as the evil foil intending to ruin both Darcy and Elizabeth. She teams up with Caroline Bingley and George Wickham, but all three get their just desserts when ODC get their HEA ending.It's satisfying when Caro is told off not only by her brother but also by Jane, and Wickham finally receives a personal payback from Darcy. This story, btw, gives Lydia and Wickham a slightly different ending, which segues into the sequel, ""The Adventures of Olivia Wickham"". "," I loved that the author let the characters in this story react in a way that was relatable and so very human. I enjoyed the story for everything it shared with us, for the tale that got told initially to the one it ended up being. I loved that the author let the characters in this story react in a way that was relatable and so very human. I enjoyed the story for everything it shared with us, for the tale that got told initially to the one it ended up being. I wondered how the author was going to twist the forced marriage into something welcomed, and it was beautifully crafted with a few fun relatives among the ones that are set to cause problems. Georgiana and Jane are there, and I LOVED the Colonel and Anne de Bourgh in this book! "," Not particularly clever or inspiring. I didn't even finish the last 20 pages. I was ready to be done. I don't think Kay Bee improved Jane Austin's story. "," After the disastrous proposal at Hunsford parsonage, instead of leaving immediately, Darcy is persuaded to stay at Rosings by Colonel Fitzwilliam and Anne DeBourgh, and the three cousins come up with a plan to try to change Elizabeth's negative perception of Darcy.  In this version, Anne has quite the personality, and is more than willing to become involved in Darcy's quest for Elizabeth's favor.  Georgiana is brought to Rosings to help soften up Elizabeth.This author is a talented writer and storyteller, who has the wisdom to include many characters that you can care about.  However, she also includes several villains who seem to have the most single minded vendettas against ODC.  Wickham, and a new character, Lady Winslow, have a determination to ruin the lives and happiness of Darcy and Elizabeth that is not convincingly explained.  Mrs Bennett and Lydia are made so bad that it's almost impossible to believe.  I'm not fond of variations in which Mrs Bennett is blatantly abusive to Elizabeth.Perhaps to compensate for these horrible people, the author gives a backbone to Georgiana, Jane (hurray!), and Mr Bennett  (although belatedly).  The Darcy character is okay, but his behavior is sometimes confusing, in spite of all the advice he's getting from his cousins about treating Elizabeth nicely.This is one of those stories that make me wonder how two people, like Elizabeth and Darcy, can have so much bad luck, and so many evil people out to destroy their happiness.  But the book is well written and well edited.  I recommend it highly. "," This is a most satisfactory variation.  The interference for and aid in behalf of our beloved couple from unexpected characters, the addition of a villainess, and several endearing exchanges between FD and EB makes this a very appealing and highly recommended read.  The only thing objectionable about this is how several canon characters have been made unbelievably detestable, and the realization of their deeds makes this a huge departure from Jane Austen’s humorous take on difficult situations.  Our dear couple is in essence the same as they are of Canon, and this reader loves how the author built a strong foundation to establish the appropriate angst and conflict between them.  This reader is most pleased how Elizabeth Bennet discovered her love for Fitzwilliam Darcy early on in the novel, which is the basis of a lot of the romantic angst. Although Elizabeth is strong and intelligent, she shows her weaknesses in her doubts and lack of trust in Mr. Darcy’s regard, for what woman hopelessly in love would act sensibly and reasonably when the affections of her beloved are in question? While, Mr. Darcy’s missteps prove his fallibility regardless of his goodness, honorable and respectable nature.  He may be a Darcy of Pemberley but he is also human who makes mistakes.  As much as he ardently loves his Elizabeth, his inexperience and pride in relying on his own abilities make him more appealing and perfect for the object of his affections.  This is truly a variation worth reading. "

I have long since overcome my initial abhorrence for anything not canon, and I usually won't write a review these days unless I can say something very good about the book.  However, I have been fooled by five-star reviews into buying a lot of really bad novels lately, so I am  beginning to appreciate those who are willing to tell the truth.  This story is not all bad.  The concept is interesting and some of the lighter moments (which, honestly is most of the book) are enjoyable.  However, overall, I found it rather weak with the feel of being rushed to publication.  Darcy and Bingley are more like modern-day high school boys in some scenes than the 19th-century mature gentlemen that we expect.  They laugh and giggle about everything, including getting muddy and belching loudly.  Elizabeth and Jane are absolutely bland, and Elizabeth's behavior is so beyond the pale for a regency-era character.  She touches Darcy's face and flirts openly on very short acquaintance.  And she asks questions about things that are none of her business.  In this version, there is no real conflict and no obstacles for our lovers to overcome.  I find a novel without conflict to be rather unappealing, so this may not apply to the average reader.  But the dialogue is stilted and sometimes incomprehensible.  For instance, on their third meeting, Darcy and Bingley have dinner with the Bennets and Mrs. Bennet is, true to character, bombarding Darcy with impertinent questions.  When she asks if his sister will be at the Netherfield ball, eh responds in the negative but assures her that Georgianna will be present ""for our weddings!""  What?!  At this point he is not even officially courting Elizabeth, yet no one takes note of this slip.  Instead, the focus is on the embarrassment of the girls over their mother's behavior.  I think perhaps the author meant for Mrs. Bennet to be the one to mention weddings, but it is clearly Mr. Darcy's comment.  Rather bizarre.  And there are multiple instances similar to this that, for me, made the narrative tedious to follow.  It just didn't make sense in places.  I would have enjoyed this novel thoroughly had there been more character development and a slower evolution of the romances and events.  It seemed more like the author had determined there were certain events she wanted to include in the novel and simply pieced them together without bothering to make sure all the pieces matched up.  Every quilt needs space between the panels or the artistry is lost in a confusing jumble of parts. "," I really enjoyed the first half of this story. The ODC romance proceeds at a good clip - not rushed, but briskly - with Elizabeth becoming so worked up over Wickham's supposed travails that she actually slaps Darcy.Instead of creating a break between them, Darcy immediately explains the true situation with Wickham. Then he informs Col. Forster and Mr. Bennet of Wickham's evil, which include white slavery (a new JAFF low for GW). He also enlists his cousin Col. Richard Fitzwilliam's help to capture Wickham.Darcy is also being chased by Caroline Bingley, who is portrayed as completely over the top. She is rebuked, told off, and even given the cut direct multiple times by different people (including Darcy) during this story, but nothing stops her. It was nice to see Bingley stand up to his sister - even Louisa Hurst finally gives up on Caroline - but the repetitive hunting goes on until it became ridiculous and tiresome.With Wickham out of the story by the mid-point, the story falls into the trite. Except for Caroline making a regularly occurring fool of herself, to the point where even the servants are laughing at her, the two engagements of the elder Bennet sisters slow to a crawl, dawdling along like an arthritic old washerwoman.There's long descriptions of intense looks of longing and delicious secretive kisses.....over and over, again and again, page after page, chapter after chapter. We're supposed to be entertained that Darcy shows up muddy not just once, but twice, at Netherfield, after cavorting - but innocently! - with Elizabeth. Bleccchhh.The dialogue went lame, Caroline continued her ridiculous snottiness, and the double wedding HEA happens. There are two epilogues, one detailing the changes in ODC's lives as they aged. The second tells us how Caroline Bingley's life turned out. Neither is particularly interesting. "," Love, love, love Gianna's story. Two love struck gentlemen left the Meryton Assembly that night thoughts of their own delightful Bennet daughter in their hearts and heads. When Caroline witnesses Darcy dance twice with Elizabeth Bennet, she decides that she'll compromise him that night. Thankfully, things don't work out the way she had planned, and Darcy's reaction and set down really rips her up one side and down the other. Bless the man. Bingley takes a few lessons on how to handle his sister, but does Caroline listen? No, further threats are needed from the Darcy/Bingley/Hursts camps before Caroline accepts defeat and is off to London to live on her own. The night of the Netherfield Ball even had many a local matriarch in her face laughing at her failed attempt to compromise her brother's guest. Darcy's feelings from admiration to love, from love to matrimony was a swift leap from start to finish happening in a matter of days. Had not Mr. Bennet required a few months betrothal, Darcy would have married his Elizabeth weeks after meeting her. The author's handling of wicked Wickham was one for the books. A fitting end for a well deserving person came without any effort from Darcy or Fitzwilliam. Humorous situations caused rib tickling laughter to burst throughout this story giving the usually stoic silent Darcy a whole new persona. No wonder Lizzy fell in love quickly. Their HEA was filled with few sorrows, but mostly happiness and love. Happy story. "

Read more","Discover more of the author’s books, see similar authors, read author blogs and more"," After a couple of years of reading P&P variations, it is a wonder to this reader why she hasn’t come across this author before; but most pleased to have read her first of many to follow.This variation sees Elizabeth Bennet in dire straits, being pushed into a marriage she neither consents to nor desires.  As much as readers wish Elizabeth to be always strong and courageous to avoid this kind of cruel predicament, this shows an Elizabeth helpless/hopeless as she surrenders to a dismal future she doesn’t want but forced to accept due to her selfless and sacrificing love for and duty to her family. In this circumstance, the author shows to the new generations of readers the realities of what many genteel ladies in Regency times had to endure: to be auctioned or sold off to the highest bidder like chattel.Comes in the reticent and severe Mr. Darcy, who true to form in Canon with his insults and seemingly distaste for our heroine and everyone in Meryton, who shows a kinder, compassionate side when he happens upon the distressed Elizabeth at the gardens of Netherfield on the night of Bingley’s promised ball. What follows is a friendship that slowly blossoms to esteem, respect, affection and love, on Elizabeth’s part at least.  Those still faced with a depressing future, she finds comfort in the kindness and compassion of the surprising confidant and friend that is Mr. Darcy. The thoughts and feelings of Elizabeth are raw and often times heartbreaking, especially when she discovers deep love for an unattainable man, while especially promised to another.This reader feels this story remarkable in the way Elizabeth not only fell for Mr. Darcy but also needed him as much as woman truly in love needs her beloved, even when he is not aware of it.  She might be strong and courageous but this shows Elizabeth as vulnerable and in need of support, and she is not afraid to voice that out.  While the final revelations of Fitzwilliam Darcy and conclusion wraps this endearing love story up in the most satisfying way, it is also its brevity and its fast pace that would most likely appeal to readers, possibly making this as one of their favorite variations.Despite this readers misgivings about the title, it does not make a dent on her recommendation of this novella as a must-read for fans of P&P variations. "," The story begins shortly before the Netherfield ball. To her utter disbelief, Elizabeth is commanded by her father to marry Mr Goulding, a man older than her father, and who she has always looked upon as an uncle. Shocked, and feeling betrayed by someone she thought would allow her some choice, Elizabeth walks out and meets Darcy during her ramble. She ends up confiding her troubles to him,, surprising herself, since she doesn't much like Darcy. He gradually becomes someone she can turn to, and in the days following she becomes more and more used to him, and more dependent on his thoughtful support and sympathy.This is a super sweet and romantic tale that's almost like a fantasy, in the wonderful and impossibly thoughtful ways that Darcy tries to comfort Elizabeth, and see to her health and well-being. It's completely unrealistic, but completely charming. This is definitely a swoon worthy Darcy, and a very vulnerable Elizabeth who is responsive to his kindness, and makes an effort to learn more about the man that she so harshly and quickly judged after the infamous insult at the assembly.I almost deducted a star because of Mr Bennett. While it's fine that a variation allows for some out-of-character behavior, his command to Elizabeth about the marriage, and the subsequent disposition of it, are never quite explained in a satisfactory way. It doesn't make much sense to me. However, the book is very well written and well edited. I recommend it highly for a wonderful, but short, romance. "," I couldn’t put this down once I picked it up.  Through most of the book Lizzy is alone, as per the title.  She is alone in her grief, her struggle to come to terms with her situation and her father’s callous behavior, and she is physically alone through much of the book, trying to sort herself out with her ubiquitous long walks.  But she is also not alone.This Lizzy may not be plucky enough for some, but I found her poignant in her grief and anger and I loved her determination to pull herself back to happiness, even if it took forever.  She is a good role model for what to do when life goes seriously awry.I adore this Darcy.  I hope everyone finds (and becomes) someone with such deep compassion.I am not sure I could have read this book a year ago, when I was dealing with great grief, but I think for those who are not in the raw stages of mourning it is an excellent choice. "," In Regency England a woman had zero rights, but one -the right of refusal to a marriage proposal.  Elizabeth Bennet knew that.  Mr. Bennet played his trump card - his parental authority over his underage daughter.  Elizabeth opposed this betrothal to Mr. Goulding.  while a ""nice"" man, an almost-uncle, he was not the suitor she imagined or hoped for.  Mr. Bennet and Elizabeth were at a stalemate.  Elizabeth begged time to mourn the loss of her independence.  thus, Elizabeth becomes introspective, overly thoughtful.  an impassible chasm sits between her father and herself.  she is alone.  but thank goodness for a hero!!  Mr.Darcy would be all Elizabeth would need in both silence and true friendship.  such a story!!  it is irresistible!! "," Love, love, love!!! If you love P&P you have to read this!  It is one of the best Elizabeth and Darcy love stories I have read in years!  This one is emotional and romantic and the Mr. Darcy everyone needs in their life.  Go read it now! "," Perfect read for a rainy afternoon! Sweet and romantic with more than a few small twists & turns that move the story into surprising directions. "," Interesting story! Very new twist. Well-written. Elizabeth is shocked by an announcement from her father and faces a life crisis. A friend provides comfort indirectly. She works valiantly to see the best side of all that she faces. Liked it. "," This was a lovely story and just further cements Julie Cooper as a writer extraordinaire! Such a creative twist on circumstances that bring ODC together with excellent versions of D&E.

Melanie was invited to post on DarcyandLizzy.com, and is now an author there. She can be found on Goodreads as an author. Her blog is http://www.melschertz.com"," 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 starsThis author has a wild imagination which is why I have read many of her stories despite her lack of a good proof reader or editor to correct the many errors. This story (as one other review states) really has little to do with canon.Jane and Elizabeth are not Bennets in this tale - thus the name in the title. I won't outline all the various relationship but do know that Elizabeth Fitzwilliam and Fitzwilliam Darcy are cousins and have long been attached to each other. However, in reflecting canon, we again have Lady Catherine and her daughter, Anne, insisting that Darcy is engaged to Anne and those two not letting go of that premise despite the rest of the family's opposition.As the blurb tells us Elizabeth is crippled due to a carriage accident in which her parents and her older sister, Jane were killed. Now, several years later, jewelry which was stolen the day of the accident begins to show up in London at a pawn shop owned by Mr. Gardiner. Ironically he recognized some of the jewelry as the Lambton craftsman is known, and related, to him. He had seen it being crafted. Thus he brings it to the Fitzwilliams and a search begins to find the murdering thieves.This story does have Bingley as a friend of Darcy but when Bingley leases Netherfield it is Kitty to whom he is attracted. His sister, Caroline, plays a large role in this tale as, even though she is engaged to a peer from Austria, she sees Darcy as a bigger ""catch"". (It seems her fiancé is not as wealthy as rumored and he is marrying her for her dowry.) I did like how various friends came together to thwart Caroline's plans to compromise Darcy and also in how Elizabeth ""puts down"" Caroline who is not hesitant to talk ""trash"" to and about Elizabeth.The Bennets do have three daughters and I am sure I don't have to name them. Mary has already married Collins and his part in the story has a different ending. There is also Wickham who joins in the behind-the-scenes plotting.Anne de Bourgh is not the weak and insipid woman of canon but I won't give you more than that hint.This was a different story without the misunderstandings we all know about from P&P canon. Darcy and Elizabeth, being from the same family, do not have a difference in wealth and connections. Even with her parents and sister dead Elizabeth is well provided for. "," Lizzy is the cousin of Darcy. Her road is rough, but her and Darcy come to an understanding early. There are the typical antagonists. "," 1.5 stars rounded up. This story resembles P&P in no way at all but for the names of the characters. Well, most of them. Elizabeth is not a Bennet but the younger daughter of the Fitzwilliam family's second son (hence the title of the book). Injured in a carriage accident at the age of twelve, E is raised by her father's sister's family, the Darcys. Eventually, of course, E and D fall in love. In this story, both of D's parents are alive as well as Lady Anne's mother (and father for a part of the book).This is one of those stories where the bad guys are ridiculously evil while all the good guys are completely infallible. Anne de Bourgh hinges on insane, Caroline Bingley is absurdly full of her own imagined importance, Lady Catherine is even worse, and ""Collins"" is pure evil. Wickham seemed rather superfluous to the plot. He was named but did almost nothing. It felt as though the author had not place for him but couldn't fathom a P&P without W being one of the antagonist so just kind of threw him in there.Meanwhile, all the Fitzwilliams and the Darcys are everything kind, generous, intelligent, rational and all around perfect. Even the Bennets are completely benign with Mrs.B reevaluating many of her previously held beliefs and behaviors when she meets the Fitzwilliams and Darcys.The writing here is pretty awful which made the story difficult to follow at times. It jumped scenes a lot with no warning. At one point, we were shopping with the ladies in Meryton--suddenly I'm riding along with Bingley. But there was no smooth transition. I was reading about the ladies then the next paragraph opened with ""Charles Bingley was doing this...."" It took me a minute to realize B wasn't in the shop but that we had left Meryton behind all together. Missing words, extra words, incorrect punctuation, run-on sentences, inconsistent writing. Not enough dialogue tags. In nearly every scene there were more than two or three people, but without dialogue tags, it got really confusing cuz I couldn't figure out who was speaking. This was difficult to read.A lot of inconsistencies. When Sir Lewis is mentioned, he's labeled a baronet. But for the rest of the story, he's a baron. LCdB is harping on Lady Anne about how unworthy Gerald Darcy is due to his lack of title, yet she wants nothing more than for her daughter to marry his equally untitled son. E is said to have a natural talent for music yet anytime she's asked to play, she shies away for lack of talent and, at one point, Lady Anne agrees that she's out of practice. When Edward Gardiner brings the jewelry to his wife and she doesn't see how she could be of any help, but then recognizes every single piece becuz, Oh, yeah! Her dad made them and suddenly she's an expert on the Fitzwilliam and Darcy families. Maybe that's not inconsistent but it was ridiculously convenient.I cannot recommend this story. 1)It's nothing that hasn't been written before. One or both of the de Bourgh women being single-mindedly obsessed with AdB marrying D and doing anything to achieve that end. 2)The writing is just awful. I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 becuz I did think the Collins' identity twist was creative. "," A what if story with Elizabeth born as a Fitzwilliam not a Bennet her father was the second son of Lord Matlock.  The Fitzwilliam and Darcy families are devastated by a carriage accident killing Elizabeth’s mother, father, and sister Jane leaving Elizabeth’s severely injured.  Someone tried to kill Elizabeth and her family and still wants her dead.The story is short and fast paced.  There was so much more that could have made this story wonderful.  The family dynamics were explained but I did not connect with them.  Caroline Bingley was a madwoman.  I understood the idea of Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam being in love for so long but I missed seeing how their bond grew over the years.  I guess it was a victim of being a short story. "," While some of the characters from P&P are included, I did not care for the placement of Lizzy as a Fitzwilliam. Marriage between first cousins was acceptable at the time, but it makes me vaguely uncomfortable anytime a story includes such a marriage. (Such discomfort occurs in any variation that includes it. A Bennett daughter marrying Collins is not as bad because he is described as a distant cousin.)Aside from the above, the relationship between ODC was secondary to all the action taking place throughout the story. Family hierarchy was difficult to follow at times. When the reader ignores the connection to the original P&P, this book becomes an okay regency/historical fiction story. Recommended with reservations. "

They are neighbors and close friends. Even as adults, they remain in touch with one another.There's well-crafted banter between Elizabeth and Darcy. When Elizabeth makes a critical decision about her life, it changes Darcy's view of her – but she continues to see him only as a childhood friend. It takes considerable time before Elizabeth questions her choice – is it wrong to be rational, after all?It's a sweet story of Elizabeth and Darcy going from friends to something deeper. But there isn't much of P&P actually in this story. Elizabeth is wealthy and eligible. Darcy's pride is conquered while he is still young. It's a romance and very romantic, but it bears very little resemblance to Austen's original masterpiece. "," Ms. Moretti borrows the situation here from Jane Austen's Emma - Elizabeth and Jane are the only two daughters of the widowed Mr. Bennet, who owns a profitable unentailed estate in Highbury.Yes, Highbury, with all its other usual inhabitants except the Knightleys. In this mixed universe, it's Pemberley that sits nearby, and the Darcy, Bingley, and Bennet children grow up together.Charles and Jane speedily marry once they're grown. Even though Elizabeth and young Mr. Darcy are the closest of friends, their route to the altar is far more circuitous and, at times, torturous.And that's the crux of the story, describing how their relationship evolves over the years. They banter with, debate with, and depend upon each other, but it takes quite a while for either of them to realize they're in love.The setting moves from Highbury to London, where Jane and Charles Bingley (like Emma's Isabella and John Knightley) reside. Elizabeth's London friends include Mary Crawford (from JA's Mansfield Park). The author adds original characters, Lord Cowper and Mr. Gladstone, who create complications for the couple.It's an interesting mashup. Though it doesn't bear much similarity to P&P's plot, the characters are recognizable and seem consistent with what you'd expect from them under these circumstances. You'll find neither pride nor prejudice factoring into the story, but Elizabeth is NOT Emma - no matchmaking or meddling.The quality of Ms. Moretti's writing is excellent, with a final proposal scene that I found particularly lovely.Content is clean. "," This is a large changes variation- 1) the Bennetts live in Derbyshire and not at Longbourn, 2) Jane and Lizzy are the only Bennett girls, 3) Mrs. Bennett has died, and 4) the Bennetts, while not rich,  are not hurting for money and the girls have good dowries. The premise being Elizabeth and Darcy grew up together as neighbors and are very close. It was an interesting story about the relationship and its various stages and changes as they mature. Aside from the characters being inspired by Pride and Prejudice there isn't much that links back to the original book but I thoroughly enjoyed it anyway. "," This is a quick read that blends characters from other Austen variations with P & P, although the characters from the other books tend to be very minor characters. Mr. Bennet and Elizabeth live in Highbury, neighbours to Pemberley. Mrs. Bennet and the younger sisters are not a thing. Elizabeth is fairly well off. Elizabeth is interested in furthering female educational opportunities. Darcy is a family friend who is two years older than Elizabeth. He has proposed to her unsuccessfully in their youth and makes another offer after Elizabeth's father dies but she declines and goes to live with Jane and Bingley. It takes them both quite a bit of time to figure out it's not just a comfortable friendship but something more breathless. I love this author's style "," But as soon as our couple finally understood each other, it was as if the author decided the story was too short. The end was confusing, felt rushed, jumped places and times and quite simply didnt add to the story. Had each section fit into book where it belonged, it could have been great. "," a near perfect love story.  an almost unhappy ending.  Jane Austen's P&P intertwined with Emma.  our hero and heroine grow up together.  the tale begins Darcy age seventeen, Elizabeth fifteen. Darcy rationalizes everything and so sees a marriage (of sorts) to his young friend.  oh, dear.  Darcy is really a meathead.  Elizabeth has only friendship in mind.  Mr. Bennet is her mainstay - her main man.  that is, until his death.  which takes Elizabeth to London with all its sights and sounds, along with its sordid ilk.  Darcy and Elizabeth are constantly crossing paths, always - as friends.  until Elizabeth becomes engaged. just not to Darcy. (NO!!! don't do it, Elizabeth.)  well, Reader, just read this falling-in-love story.  and thank you, Laura Moretti.  just a perfect love story! "," This variation starts so far from canon that the reader must flounder for a while. Where is Highbury? What happened to Longbourn? Why are the Bennets rich, living near to the Darcys, and a family with only two daughters?Most of these questions are answered...sort of, but many others just must be set aside. This is a nice book, but only the names are the same, it is totally different, not really a variation. "," The premise is good, but the story drags in places.  I do not care for the use of characters from other Austen novels.  Never would I remove Emma Woodhouse from her ancestral home nor Elizabeth Bennet from hers. "

The Bennets (Benitez) are an immigrant family: Elisa and her younger sister Leticia are an “anchor babies,” their parents and older sister, Noa, are undocumented. The Darcys and Binglys (Darcy and Leighs) are Republican politicians and political operatives during the Trump run for the presidency in 2016. There is some very real conflict in this story. The stakes are very high and very realistic.I could see that Garrett was trying to be respectful to both sides of the immigration issue. But I can also see how a lot of people may not be able to connect with this story because of that.One of the things I thought Garrett did exceptionally well was how she wove this story through the structure of Jane Austen’s original work. There are a lot of differences in relationships between characters, size of characters’ parts, the timeline of events, etc, but pretty much every significant thing that happens in the original P&P happens here, too, and even some less significant things—including some conversations that are nearly identical to the original in content if not exactly wording, And it’s done almost seamlessly—if you haven’t read or watched P&P before you would never guess. I was amazed at how naturally it all seemed to happen—only a couple of times did I think it felt forced.The characters were likable and had a good rapport with each other. Sometimes when people do modernizations, the Elizabeth character can be a little too mean in her judgmentalism—not that Lizzy isn’t judgmental, but she’s never outright mean when speaking to the person—she may tease or talk circles around the person, but she’s not biting or insulting. Garrett did a good job sticking to that aspect of Elisa’s personality—she judged, but she wasn’t mean to the person about it.Overall, this was a very well done modernization. "," Intriguing, politically bent story that was well adapted in to the modern era. It felt like the author had thorough knowledge of PnP by the way she had incorporated a few of the more subtle traits from PnP, in a new and interesting way,  like the relationship between Darcy and Caroline.The Benitez family was Mexican immigrants, some legal, some not and I thought the plot highly relevant today, (although the American political system is a huge mystery to me) it was set around the time of Trump's election.It had one major flaw though, which I have noticed in a lot of the modern variations I have read. Elizabeth, or Elisa as she was called in this story, was too mean and cutting, making it hard to believe Darcy could fall for her. When the ""Jane sick at Netherfield"" is missing and the ""liking Wickham"" is elaborated, I just cannot see the reason for attraction...Despite of this flaw, I really liked the book. It was  interesting, engaging and well written.The Benitez was managing lodges for rent and Elisa was visiting to help them out as her father had a broken ankle. Ben (Bingley) had rented a cabin and brought his sister Carolin, his friend Darcy and eventually Darcy's sister Giana.The insult while Elisa was cleaning their cabin was delivered and Noa, Elisa's usually shy older sister was hitting it off with Ben until the Benitez mother put her foot in it a party.  Revealing Noa as a DACA which meant she only had a temporary permission to stay in the country and needling Ben to get her a more permanent solution, made Ben run...Back in LA, Elisa got a job as PT for the famous Giana while going on Rally with Wickham who had a history with the Darcy's. Letitia (Lydia), the third and final sister does have a debacle with Wickham and Darcy saved the day.Ends in a HEA.This was not a sweet and romantic story but an engaging story that left me with a lot of food for thought and a little more insight in to the immigration issues in the US.Recommend "," Even though it’s been two years since the presidential election, a lot of the story brought so much of it back to me. The idea that Clinton was “definitely” going to win and there’s no way Trump could win is what I remember the most. I liked how the author gave us essentially both sides of the political coin and showed that maybe we have become too polarized. Darcy spoke to me on a personal level because he’s not on any extreme side of the political spectrum. While he’s actively Republican, he leaves room for himself to think “liberally” on some issues. The reality is many of us feel that way, regardless of political affiliation.Very interesting variation and I got to enjoy a Latina Elizabeth Bennet. Being Latina myself a lot of the things in her life and family rang so true and familiar to me.The unique storyline with the original embedded in made the story enjoyable to read. However, I have to admit I felt disappointed with my favorite couple. Considering everything they went through, the coming together and the way it ended felt a bit dry to me. And somewhat forced. Interestingly, they do talk about the various obstacles facing them as a couple, and I felt in the end that maybe they should’ve just broken up. That’s how NOT invested I felt. Darcy was more convincing in his affection. Elisa was a bit more difficult to believe in my opinion. Did I enjoy reading through their trials and tribulations? Yes. But I wasn’t captivated by it. I was more captivated by the context of the story and how truly modern it felt.The antagonists were okay and one (Lady Catherine’s character) was surprising. But we got the most out of the Caroline and Wickham characters. The Lydia character (Letitia here) was obnoxious in true Lydia fashion. I was over her real quick.And because I know this is a deal breaker for readers, I’d like to point out this story is clean and a “sweet” story. Maybe that’s why I felt the dryness behind it.Would read this again simply because it’s a refreshing take on a story that’s been rewritten countless times. "," This was a modern Jane Austin. Very well done with all the concerns we are living under! But love triumphs all! "

I discovered I had it on my first Kindle (the First Fire) when I transferred to my second (5th Gen) and, on impulse, read it again. I had loaded the first with a bunch of freebies like Huckelberry Finn, public domain titles all.  I don't know exactly why I did a search after reading it or if I was prompted by Amazon, probably the latter. but I found this title and it was cheap so I got it.  I had been intrigued that Jane Austen could hold my interest as she cited long conversations and chronicled ruminations about people who would ordinarily bore me. This time I wanted more, I guess.  Then, I suspect, the underlying erotic implications Austen's narrative--the kind of subterranean gravity that she underlays the long conversations and mundane social details that, hold my interest, notwithstanding my usual expectations of something happening.  Ms. Brown kept slipping into the crevices in the classic and archetypal story and filling them with hotness. Its like she was updating it; filling in that which could not be disclosed in the days after the French Revolution when England's elite was trying to show themselves as more virtuous than the French, and therefor not deserving of the guilotine -- or some such.  Georgette Brown does a good job exploiting the idea that what was left unsaid could be more extreme than one would imagine. That Lizzie and her cohort was more libidinous,  than we modern people if only because they were so repressed. She spins it into a good hot yarn while remaining true (more or less) not only to the story but to the modern take on ""romance novels."" of ""torn bodice"" type.  Maybe it is because I am older, but I was as surprised that I enjoyed this kind of slower paced erotica, but Ms. Brown uses the development of Austen's story to slip up on the erotic episodes and give them some novelty and variation. Still without taking it too far from Lizzie's nature as explicated by Austen; meaning Elizabeth does not become a Fanny Hill -- at least not overnight. "," I was delighted by the weaving of Jane Austen’s story by coauthor Georgette Brown.  Let me state unequivocally, I am a Jan Austen fan.  I have read all of her books more than once.  I have read all the selections from the Austen Project as well as many of the too numerous to count “variations.”  I read the first ten chapters as an Advance Review Copy last summer and was impatient for the full version of the story.  With this full version at first I focused on the differences contributed by Ms. Brown, however I soon relished her backstory.  Brown’s contributions present a very plausible explanation to some continuity gaps in Austen’s original version. The steamy scenes were rather mild, yet titillating.  There was respect for each other and the act.  The possibility of women being able to control their pleasure in that era was enlightening.  I am pleased there was no BDSM.  That would have been too much too bear.  The character of Mrs. Trenwith was a perfect foil for the two star crossed lovers of Darcy and Lizzie. I heartily recommend this novel.  I intend to read Pride, Prejudice and Pleasure again along with the original Pride and Prejudice. Consider me a Georgette Brown fan. "," I would have rated this story much higher had the author not felt it necessary to copy and paste the original story into this. I found myself skipping through many chapters because if I wanted to read Pride and Prejudice, I would just do that.That being said, however, this was a very sexy story. You certainly have to suspend your belief here because Elizabeth suddenly being wanton and wanting a hands on sex education is pretty radical. But oh did it work here. Lizzy and Darcy as student and mentor was great to read and the passion leapt off the pages. Each “lesson” was better than the last and I could read this story again and again. This was a Darcy of my dreams....It would have worked so much better as an original novella without all the fluff thrown in. But at the price it’s being sold I’d still go for it. "," There are loooong passages of the original Austen text that only sometimes is interwoven with the variation plot. So much of it is included as to not only border on plagiarism but also bore the reader because (presumably) they have already read or at least are aware of the key points of P&P from watching different film productions. There are several chapters that I flat out skipped because nothing new had been added or enhanced the core story.Had the authors skimmed over the pertinent P&P parts with quick summaries and focused on the variation plot, the story would have been so much richer and rewarding.Taking this into account, any future readers who are not faint of heart should definitely spend the time on this variation! "," If you have a copy of Pride and Prejudice, take it down off the shelf, dust it .off and reread it.  You’ll have save yourself $$$ spent for this book.  There were four sexual lessons it the book to remind you that book was written by Georgette Brown and not Jane Austin.  The reason I gave it three stars is that the last chapter was very good, in giving, the resolution to all the main characters.  This resolution was never given in the original Austin but taken care of very well by Ms Brown. "," The problem with this book was the inclusion of too much dialogue verbatim from P&P 1980, 1995 and 2005. The highlights were the storyline surrounding the new character and the intimate, sexually charged scenes between Lizzy and Darcy. Definitely for the grown and sexy crowd. "," So there was essentially the original story with a few new situations included. Copied and pasted to the point of exactly the original. Would have liked more variation. "

Brilliant and beautiful, the human women they meet seem poised to do more harm than good.Elizabeth Bennet may have been raised on an alien world but she knows enough about human men to recognize a snub when confronted with one.

The “dog” aliens were nonsensical  and  showed writers inexperience at sci fi.  But overall very clever take and creative. "," Great sci-fi variation that wasn't too technical to enjoy as a romance. Well developed and well written and I absolutely loved that it came with pictures! I enjoy P & P variations and this one did not disappoint. Writing it and trying to stay true to P&P characters  and places would have been challenging, and the authors did a great job. Enjoy! "," If you love P&P and you are a fan of books that go into the future as well as the past, you have it here. Ms McMann says she is no Scientist but her story holds together just fine for fiction.

Still worth reading but not my favorite done by this author duo. "," This book is well written as are all of their books.  It was light and enjoyable.  A great deal of thought went into developing the worlds,  the crossovers of events in pride and prejudice were very well thought out and executed.  Why not a 5 Star ?  I simply didn't enjoy ODC not in regency England.  Thus the 4 stars.  However this was not the writers fault.  I expected to enjoy the book, I was disappointed in myself for not enjoying it more as they are one of my favorite authors.  Excellent premise.  I was sure many people will throughly enjoy.

After finishing his studies, Mr. Wickham finds work in Meryton with Mr. Phillips, a local solicitor and the Bennets' uncle.By the time that the Netherfield party arrives, the Bennets are well-acquainted with Mr. Wickham. He is even engaged to one of the Bennets! How will this altered Wickham influence the rest of the characters and their road to happily ever after? Will Darcy still look down on the Bennets and their connexions, even if one of those connexions is his childhood best friend?  Read more","Growing up, Clarissa was such a bookworm that her mother had to ground her from her books to make her do her household chores. At nine years old, she read Pride and Prejudice for the first time. The book had a luxurious red velvet cover, with golden trimmed pages and delightful illustrations. This version is still the one she uses when she wants to look back at the text.Clarissa Joy Thomas and her family, including two pet bunnies, live in Wisconsin, USA. Writing is an escape for Clarissa, as she can control what happens (at least to some extent). She encourages anyone who wants to write a book to do so. There are never enough books in the world. "," This variation had so many characters and storylines.  Collins and Wickham were not villains-what???I liked that Elizabeth and Darcy were the same as their P&P characters.  We did not have to suffer Caroline.  Lady CdeB was awful- worse than usual.Lots of direct quotes from the book but use by different characters.  I found that funny.  There were many enjoyable moment with no explicit sex - Loved that it was off script.The reason for the 4 stars is some parts were confusing - I had to reread portions to understand.  However it did not stop me from reading the book. "," I really liked the portrayal of Kitty and Mary in the version as well as Wickham. Although I’m never a fan of Jane marrying Bingley, this variation had enough new character changes and twists that their union seemed like the right choice. Perhaps the fact that she didn’t come across as a living mannequin helped. Hooray to the author for ridding us of Caroline early in the story. Too bad she couldn’t have taken Mrs Bennet with her. "," A light and pleasant story wherein Wickham actually follows through with his statement to Darcy that, instead of taking orders and accepting the Kympton living upon Mr Darcy Sr's death, he would use the value of the living to study law. He becomes a solicitor and finds a position with Mr Phillips in Meryton, thus coming to know everyone in that area. He and Mary Bennett are accidentally compromised and must get married. Wickham is a reformed rake, drinker, and gambler. But he's turned over a new leaf and becomes a wonderful husband. When the Bingleys and Darcy arrive in the neighborhood, it's a friendly reunion with Wickham, and his familiarity with the Bennetts helps smooth things over as they all become acquainted.This is a low angst story. The usual villains appear, but they're dealt with handily and easily. There's no great opposition to any of the relationships. In fact, although the story spans maybe one year, all five of the Bennett daughters get married within that time. It seemed that the author felt that everyone should be disposed of in marriage so that they could start popping out scores of babies.I deducted a couple of stars for a couple of reasons. First, I was disappointed that Darcy had to be convinced by his cousin that he should pursue Elizabeth. There was no great love for the ages that overcame all of his hesitations over social standing, fortune, and connections. One minute he's resolved against Elizabeth, but as soon as Colonel Fitzwilliam says he should pursue her, he changes his mind.My other issue is the amount of text lifted verbatim from P&P. A small reference here and there is acceptable and almost unavoidable. However, there's quite a lot in this book, and I consider that as laziness. I much prefer to read an author's own creations. I already know what the wonderful Jane Austen wrote. I want to see what Ms Thomas can create.The book is well written and well edited. I recommend it with the exception of the above reservations. "," This book actually had a *gasp* redeemed Wickham and it made an absolutely huge difference in how our story played out. I enjoyed it. "," An excellent, low angst, clean P&P variant wherein the usually villainous George Wickham instead experiences an epiphany and reforms himself in time to take up the occupation of law clerk in a small town in Hertfordshire. But despite his honorable intentions, he accidentally compromises one of the Bennet daughters – the most unlikely match of all.That leads to a very different affair for Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. They will be joined in romance by not just Jane and Charles Bingley, but also great changes in the lives of Kitty and Lydia.There are still obstacles to the HEA for Elizabeth and Darcy, and the forces opposing their marriage are stronger than they think. When Anne de Bourgh disappears, Darcy feels he must join the search, despite cousin Richard being better at strategizing and organization. A ransom note is received, announcing that Anne will be left unharmed if her dowry is surrendered to them in cash.If Anne is indeed alive but compromised, will Darcy feel compelled to save her reputation by marrying her? Or is there a chance they can find her and capture her kidnappers?Lydia remains eager to marry first, enraptured by officers in red coats. Kitty matures and wants a husband who will respect and protect her. Which one of them will find the right man – if such a man even exists? "," There is not much in the story that kept me on my toes, motivating me to read instead of checking YouTube or the news. "," It was such an original concept, and I loved all the romances. I only wish I could erase the book from my mind and read it for the first time again!!! "," Tale of the Bennet sisters and their various loves.  Couldn’t put it down read in one day.  Sorry it ended.

Author","None","Y","4.99","43,208","2020-08-23","218","4.3","871","Mrs Bennet follows her mother’s example and favours her beautiful daughters, ignoring the three middle girls, while Mr Bennet is too ill to oppose his wife’s favouritism. A new neighbour has an issue with Mrs Bennet’s attitude and intervenes by adopting the girls, giving Elizabeth, Mary and Kitty the chance to become accomplished young ladies and learn whatever else interests them. Their interests result in an unconventional education and very different sisters from the way they were destined to be. Follow their journey to adulthood and watch how events might have unfolded. This is a low angst and mostly nice and sweet story. If you like lots of drama, angst, misunderstandings and drawn out conflict, this story is probably not for you.   Read more","I have always been a bookworm. In 2018 I discovered Fan Fiction and stumbled onto Pride & Prejudice. I loved many of the stories, but often wished the characters would behave differently. I kept thinking about Elizabeth's reaction at the assembly, wondering how I would like her to respond. I jotted down bits of conversations and 'Don't flatter yourself' was born. Encouraged by the other readers I decided to publish my story. It turned out that other people liked it too.I had so much fun writing Don't flatter yourself, and receiving the positive responses, that I continued writing other stories.My stories will generally be low angst and have a happy ending, although not always the one people might expect. I don't pretend to write great literature, just the kind of fun stories that I would like to read. I recently re-edited my early stories and rereleased them with new covers.. I hope you will find them improved.I live in Australia, used to work in IT, and love full contact martial arts and bad puns.I hope you enjoy my stories.btw to the readers who are confused by my name, I am (and always have been) happily female. "," This is a very unique variation in which Mrs. Bennet actually hates and neglects her three daughters: Elizabeth, Mary, and Kitty. She only loves Jane and Lydia because they look like her, blonde hair and blue eyes. Mr. Bennet is very sickly in this story, so much so that he cannot curtail his wife's treatment of the three girls.  Enter their savior, Mrs. Stephanie Mortimer, a wealthy widow who offers to adopt the three girls. Mr. Bennet finally agrees knowing that his daughters will be treated well and loved. Mrs. Mortimer is well connected in the Ton, but prefers living in the country. Her estate, Brook Hall, is not far from Longbourn.  After settling the girls each in their own rooms, she makes plans to have her adopted daughters well educated not only in what all young ladies of consequence should know, but also what each wants to pursue. Being very unconventional herself, she is not surprised that Elizabeth wants to learn to ride astride, fence, and shoot. A governess, masters, and an arms-mistress to teach her daughters self-defense.  Fast forward four years when Mr. Bennet dies, Collins Sr. and son arrive. Mr. Collins is a brute of a man; whereas, William is cowed and ill-treated by his father.  Collins forces himself on Mrs. Bennet, but before he can compromise Jane, Mrs. Mortimer arrived from London so now Mr. Bennet's will can be read. His two remaining daughters  become the wards of Mrs. Mortimer. Jane settings into her new life, but spoiled Lydia needs many consequences before she finally comes around. Mrs. Bennet finally gives birth to the heir of Longbourn, Collins and his abused son are removed. Days later, William Collins returns to Meryton badly beaten by his now dead father. He is taken in by Mrs. Mortimer and given an education. What I really liked about this variation is the strength of Mrs. Mortimer and all of her adopted daughters. When Jane and Elizabeth make their presentation to the Queen, Elizabeth and Darcy actually see one another, but are not introduced, but he is intrigued by her. She helps him avoid Caroline Bingley, but does not fawn or seek his attention.  Jane has to use her self-defense skills to stop a compromise attempt, and does it with such grace that nobody really knows what happened.  Of course, the ""gentleman"" does because our mild mannered, gentle Jane broke his ankle.  Three years have gone by when Bingley takes the lease on Netherfield.  The usual characters are with him in this variation, and Darcy is still avoiding Caroline Bingley. During the Meryton Assembly he recognizes Mrs. Mortimer and when Bingley badgers him to dance, he realizes that before him sits the girl that he's been looking for since seeing her at his Aunt Matlock's ball. Accepting an introduction and requesting a dance, he is so intrigued that he requests permission to call on her. As they grow closer, Caroline grows more desperate and finally ruins herself by attempting a compromise. Wicked Wickham arrives with the militia and tried using his usual sad tale , but Elizabeth sets him straight. Wickham has an evil plan of revenge against Darcy by compromising one of the Mortimer girls, preferably Elizabeth. What he hadn't taken into account was their sisterly care for one another and the skill and ferocity to protect each other.  The results of protecting their younger sister is witnessed by Darcy, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and Bingley.  Both cousins are impressed with the ladies, but Bingley was shaken by what he witnessed. He withdraws from Jane leaving Colonel Fitzwilliam's desires for Jane a reality. What I especially liked about this story was the care the three girls received from Mrs. Mortimer.  I also enjoyed the strong relationships that developed between the five sisters and their new mother, the women and their cousin William Collins, and the ladies and their suitors.  While there were errors, whether spelling or wrong word choices, they didn't detract from the flow of the story.  I have this story a 5 star rating because of its uniqueness that gave gave Mrs. Bennet's rejected daughters a new lease on life. "," This might be the penultimate in reimagining P&P with modern sensibilities but keeping it in early 19th century England. Mrs. Bennet is the true villain here, so focused on needing a son to break the entail that she cannot value her daughters for being healthy, lively, bright children. She hates her middle three daughters, loving only Jane and Lydia because they look the most like her.**SPOILERS**Slowly dying, Mr. Bennet is persuaded by wealthy widow Mrs. Mortimer to let her adopt Elizabeth, Mary, and Kitty. She promises to take good care of the girls, and because she lives nearby, Jane and Mr. B visit Mrs. Mortimer and the girls often. When Mr. B dies, his will leaves Mrs. Mortimer as guardian to all five girls.Mrs. B is discovered to be pregnant, and when a son is born, the entail is broken. Jane and Lydia are shocked to discover their mother's attention is solely focused on their new brother Joshua. She neither wants nor cares that Jane and Lydia must go live with Mrs. Mortimer. Jane is glad, but Lydia is deeply shocked. She has always been spoiled and indulged by her mother, and it takes a long time before she changes her ways to become part of the Mortimer family circle.Mrs. Mortimer is both educated and unconventional in her interests, and encourages all the girls to become not just genteel, well-bred ladies, but also to understand estate management, learn to cook, discuss philosophy and history, learn foreign languages, and even practice defending themselves – with weapons and without them.William Collins has been rewritten to be an abused son, who becomes orphaned and destitute. He turns to Mrs. Mortimer for help, and becomes an educated, sensible young man.When Netherfield is rented by Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy realizes that Miss Elizabeth is the young lady he met three years ago in London. He was struck by how natural and unaffected she was, but never learned her name and never saw her again. He immediately makes an effort to begin a friendship with her, while Bingley rhapsodizes over the angelic Jane.When Wickham arrives in Meryton, his insinuations about Darcy fall flat. Due to his friendship with the Mortimer family, Darcy is well-regarded in Meryton. Angered, Wickham attempts to harm one of the sisters, only to be stopped by Elizabeth and Jane.Bingley is so shocked by Jane's aggressive defense of her sister, he realizes he was only infatuated with her appearance. Shamed by his weakness, he withdraws from Jane with an apology. This leaves the field open for another suitor, who is happy to step in and take his place.This story ends with Elizabeth and Darcy at their wedding. Everyone is happy – save for Mrs. Bennet, who slipped into the furthest back row. She has finally come to accept that her neglect of her daughters drove them away from her, and she has no one but herself to blame.The story continues with ""Unconventional Ladies"", Bk 2 of this 2-book series. "," I am not a huge fan of Austen redos....but when this title came up and I could both books in the series for one price....why not.  I have not read any other books by this Author yet (until I read the second book, as soon as this write-up is finished) but am so glad I did.Mrs. Stephanie Mortimer is the mother you wished you had...I loved her backstory...and the fact that the story from P&P is the same with the same character s but in ways that yes, you could definitely see them in that way!Mr. William Collins younger is so much nicer in this story (although the editor could have done a better job, when you meet him, he is introduced as 9,10,11 years old when in fact, 10 years older)Mrs. Mortimer believes in teaching her daughter's all the want to know and more as in how to protect themselves which comes in handy as they grow older.  And Mrs. Mortimers  husband also felt the same and encouraged her outlook.I am writing this at 4 am after finishing it....it does start slowly, but oh my, by the end you are laughing and just enjoying the whole situation....people whom you thought you knew are in New situations, with SPOILERS people ending up with not who they did before, but people who are better suited for them!  I am also looking forward the the book about Charlotte!Just sit back and enjoy the ride with this new version big P&P! "," Sometimes P&P variations are so similar, characters and scenarios get muddled in my mind. Not this story with its distinct differences. I enjoyed it very much! I would highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for something different. "

The characters are all recognizable from Jane Austen's original work, but they are given new dimensions and depths that make them feel fresh and exciting. "," This book is another of those that use the names of ODC and make a story that doesn’t resemble the characters at all. It’s also sophomoric. They meet at a ball.

A search ensues, search ends, Darcy takes longer to overcome class differences, but that’s also resolved with no apparent effort. Ugh.

Nearly everything she says has a very logical and obvious counter, which Darcy explains, but author has Elizabeth bring up previous disagreements repeatedly through every argument. Elizabeth is consistently portrayed as petty, contrary, and small minded in her complaints, while Darcy is objectively correct, with his only failure in communication being that Elizabeth simply did not like the way he said something.I personally find variations where Elizabeth is almost always wrong and Darcy is almost always right to be difficult to read.The premise is good which is why I gave this three stars. "," There are a few typos but you can still read through them.  I like it when you keep Jane Austen’s characters name, ex,  John Fitzwilliam instead of Richard Fitzwilliam, Miriam Gardner instead of Madeleine Gardner.  The book was excellent and I really could not put it down.  I think the ending was a little anti climatic. "," Some good and bad for me on this one.  Bad, didn't love this version of Elizabeth at the beginning of the story.  It did get better and more like the true and loved Elizabeth.  It did start to really come together for me at that point.  The miserable original proposal from Mr Darcy happens.  Then they are compromised and forced to marry.  Noone is handling that well.  Once the Darcys find common ground the story really gels and becomes lovely.  Even takes it to a warm level in the relationship.  I however would have liked a few more of those sweet wuei moments for the happy couple. "," This is a compromise, through and through.

I’m not sure about women’s clothing back then but her dress uncovers herself causing the compromise.  The couple marry quickly to avoid scandal and Lady Catherine.  The story continues with couple learning to forgive each and love each other.This story had me disliking Elizabeth very much and I don’t enjoy stories where Elizabeth is a bit too much.  However the story kept me entertained with Darcy being the gentlemen we all love. "," The story begins immediately following the first proposal and promptly leaves canon to go on a mortifying jaunt. The Darcy in this book is to me, true to character but I don't feel that way as much with Elizabeth. The storyline is a little on the dramatic side but in a lighthearted way. Other than the beginning of the story most of the strife is between Darcy & Elizabeth with them often misunderstanding each other and misjudging each other.Sexytimes:No. It's a clean one.HEA: yesEditing: reading via text to speech, I only noticed one typo.Recommended: I'm on the fence with this one.

The idea that  both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth have to marry had a lot of potential but I was very disappointed because none of the characters were developed.I have read a lot of P&P variations and it is always welcome to read how one unexpected even changes so many things and affects so many people in different ways but in this case i was disappointed because there was no redemption for Mr Bennet and no punishment for Wickham, even Elizabeth sounded more like Lidya throwing tantrums and being scared of Lady Catherine? That was not the strong, stubborn Lizzy we all know and love. "," Lizzy is a bit more naive in this story but really, it’s seem appropriate that a 20 year old woman in rural England who has never had a season or traveled much would be naiveWickham and Lydia have the same story this time. It was unclear how he wasn’t in the militia anymore. So he gets a position with a shipyard instead of with a regular army unit. With Wickham’s history with the Darcys, if I was Lizzy, Uncle Gardiner or Mr. Bennet, I would have asked Darcy to send W and L to the colonies or taken care of Wickham in a more permanent way. I would live in fear of him kidnapping a child someday.I recommend the book "

I think you will like this story very much.  It is very well written, as always. "," I did not like this book because this girl is not Lydia Benett.  Lydia is selfish, mean and has no idea of right or wrong.  If you have read P&P you know this.  You also know that Elizabeth Benett is the most charming woman ever written about by any author.  So now she is a meany and Lydia is a charmer.  Did not work for me.  The author could write this story and name Lydia some thing else and it would work, but let us not lose our minds and try to make the characters in P&P some one they are not.  Come up with a new adventure but do not change the people.  Lydia had no shame when she eloped with Wickham and did not care when or even if they married.  Stupid stupid girl.  That is what Elizabeth said when she read Jane's letter.  Elizabeth was right.  No Lydia did not read books or go to see the the workers with her mother.  Neither of them cared enough to do that. "," Love this Lydia.  I've always felt that there was so much more to this spunky lady than most people were not willing to see.  By the time she came along, Mr. Bennet had retired to his book room and given up on pretty much everything.

Some of her schemes are far fetched and lead her into a lot of trouble, but she has a heart of gold and is ready and willing to learn anything someone will take the time to teach her.  Aunt Tess and Mr. Dobney see her worth immediately and are pleased to become part of her ""salvation"".  Can Marcus Dobney see what they see in Lydia?  I love this story.

Really a feel good adventure and I highly recommend it to all readers. "," I didn't expect to enjoy,  even love  this story as much as I did. Lydia is more human and believable than I thought she would be in this tale. "," I'm a fan of Leenie Brown's books and the latest in this series lives up to that expectation.  I love that Lydia gets her own book and she is as you expected...sort of.  None of us are ever as we appear to those that don't look very hard.  Very well written.

I just wish there were more scenes with D&E in this book.Looking forward to Book 4. "," This is a very amusing story. Lighthearted in tone but still enjoyable.  I like the Lydia in this story.

The Earl of Matlock is also corrupt, and in a desperate attempt to save himself from financial ruin, he kidnaps and drugs Lady Anne Darcy, who in this version is still alive, and tries to extort money from Darcy.  At the same time, Lady Catherine is still pressuring Darcy to marry Anne DeBourgh. Darcy is despondent, but has the support of Colonel Fitzwilliam and Wickham, who is a good guy in this version.Darcy comes to Netherfield Park to stay with Bingley, and he's accompanied by his mother, Georgiana, and Wickham.  Darcy is hiding his mother and sister from the earl's evil machinations.  However, eventually, their presence in Hertfordshire is discovered, and the Earl carries out some dastardly plots.  Meanwhile, Darcy meets Elizabeth at the Meryton assembly, and his attraction to her happens pretty quickly and without much fanfare.This is an interesting variation with a lot of alterations in the characters.  Besides the evil ones, and the good Wickham, the Bennetts are not so ridiculous as in the original P&P.  Caroline Bingley is not in the story.  Bingley has some backbone, as does Jane.  A lot of the characters are better and less annoying.I deducted a star because the romance was missing from the story.  Small references are made to Elizabeth's and Darcy's favorable feelings for each other, but because of the very sinister plot, the development of their relationship takes a back seat.  Also missing was our beloved fearless and dynamic Darcy.  He is so beaten down by circumstances that he's always despondent, and seems not to know what to do next.  It's Wickham that seems to steer Darcy in the right direction for much of the story.  Darcy just seems ineffectual.and unsure, a far cry from our beloved Darcy.Nonetheless, the book is well written and well edited.  This author has become an automatic purchase for me.  You can rely on her for a quality product.  I recommend it highly. "," I truly enjoy the JAFFs Ms. Kendig writes - she puts a creative twist on P&P with a masterful touch of ""What If...?"" Here we have a Darcy and Elizabeth who are from canon, yet their interactions are different because of how the story is set up. In ""...Distress"", we have a Wickham who is still Darcy's loyal and close friend.Lady Catherine remains an obstacle to ODC happiness, but is put in her place quite firmly. The shocking villains of this plot are two characters who are most often lauded by JAFF writers as noble and good - namely, Darcy's father George and the Colonel's father Earl Matlock. The senior Darcy, now deceased, was cruel to his wife Lady Anne, who has survived his callous treatment but remains fragile in her convalescence. Darcy is wracked by guilt, feeling responsible for his mother's ill-health and his sister's timidity.The three Darcys have arrived at Netherfield in the company of Bingley and some of his family. Darcy feels vulnerable: his family has become the ton's latest scandal, with scurrilous gossip chasing them out of London.When they meet the Bennets, Darcy is surprised and impressed by how kindly the two elder Bennet daughters treat his mother and sister. And Mr. Bennet is hiding a remarkable secret from everyone, that only Elizabeth and Hill, the butler, know.Colonel Fitzwilliam, a favorite with almost all P&P fans, gets to play an impressive part, although sadly gets left out of any HEA endings until the epilogue wraps things up almost twenty years later.The Earl is the active villain in this story, scheming for any kind of advantage that will work in his financial favor. Will he succeed? Or will Darcy lose not only his mother, but his sister as well?I really enjoyed this new variant. Every one of Ms. Kendig's JAFFs is in my permanent Kindle collection, and that is a rare thing for me. Highly recommended for P&P fans, especially those who enjoy a protective and masterful Darcy. "," A scandal has broken out - Lord Matlock has informed everyone that his sister Lady Anne Darcy is insane and it runs in the family with Fitzwilliam Darcy's mental health a concern!  As a result of Matlock and his heir spending every shilling his estate is on the verge of bankruptcy and he needs money from Pemberley to survive. He's planning to take over both Lady Anne and Georgiana for their dowry.  Darcy brings his family to Hertfordshire to hide out and then meets the Bennet family. Mr Bennet has been increasing the amount of money for his wife after his death by writing novels!  In the end as A result of a few unpredictable marriages the schemes to take Pemberley are dropped.  I enjoyed reading this and its light on the angst between Darcy and Elizabeth with the couple becoming friends almost from the beginning! "," Excellent variation of P&P. I like the mixing up of villains and good guys this author brought to the table. The dastards were dastardly and the heroes heroic, even when you had to become your own hero. Fanciful journeys into novel writing by one character brought nice breaks to the chapters, while still tying in with the plot of the larger story. Angst between ODC and other couples was nonexistent, which rendered this a fluffy tale indeed. Even with the drama and opposition of the antagonists of the story. Well written and well done. "," I like it when Wickham is a good guy and devoted friend. He needs a better story when he’s with Darcy. "," The pleasant connection of Elizabeth and Darcy was a delightful beginning.  The continued introduction of each of the characters truly brought them to life.  I was interested in each one as the story developed.  It was a true delight that Wickham was a good person for a change.  I enjoyed how each of the disruptive characters were well eliminated.I recommend this book without hesitation! "," With the elder Mr. Darcy a deceased scoundrel (and Lord Matlock even worse) Wickham and Darcy both turn out to be fine gentlemen, and that has made all the difference.  Several hasty but believable weddings and an interesting plot make for a very pleasant, highly original retelling of  Pride and Prejudice. "

The familiar characters from P&P are all there, but some of them can see dragons for what they are and hear them speak.  They are Dragon Friends, and Lizzie, her sister Mary, her father and her aunt and uncle Gardiner are among them.  They all have companion dragons - smaller dragons who masquerade as pets to the rest of her family, who are dragon-deaf.  Estates are named after their dragons - Longbourne is a selfish, cantankerous dragon; Mr. Bennet is the Keeper.  The Pemberley egg - which is close to hatching - has been stolen from Mr. Darcy, so he is in Meryton to look for it.  Should it hatch unsupervised, it would be a catastrophe.  He must work with the Bennets, and as expected, he clashes with Lizzie.As a dragon fantasy story, I liked this.  It was a different take on dragons and their interaction with human beings.  There were a lot of different kinds of dragons to keep track of - the glossary at the end would have been helpful earlier.  The idea of a treaty between dragons and people, and the secret government that exists between them is different.  However, I’m not sure this book works as a Pride & Prejudice variation.  The characters aren’t quite right.  Jane Austen’s Mr. Darcy is aloof and a product of his class, but in the original, meeting Elizabeth helps him learn to put his pride aside.  In this version, there’s something off about his characterization.  Mr. Bennet is unlikable and too harsh with his beloved Lizzie.  Lizzie laments that Jane is dragon-deaf; it’s the one part of her life that they can’t share.  A huge part of P&P is the close relationship between Lizzie and Jane, so that is absent here.  The events of the timeline of P&P are interspersed into this story, but by the end, they have only gotten as far as the Netherfield Ball, which happens fairly close to the beginning of the original story.  Since this is the first book in a series, I assume that the timeline will continue in subsequent novels.  In all,  while the concept is a good one, it falls a little short as a Pride & Prejudice variation.  I think I would have liked it better if it was just set in the same Regency time period, but without the constraints of the characters and events of Pride & Prejudice.  Because I have read P&P so many times, I am very familiar with those characters.  It’s jarring reading this book when their actions are often so out of character.I’m interested to see where the rest of the story goes, more for the dragon storyline than as a Pride & Prejudice variation. "," First, I have to,say that ordinarily, I am over the paranormal aspects of fiction, so initially I wavered back and forth, but I finally decided to give this book a chance.  I am so glad that I did.  Maria Grace has crafted a wonderfully readable and compelling universe where dragons and humans coexist, and peacefully, for the main part.  It was a brilliantly crafted story, and so fascinating, that I did little else but read it obsessively for hours.  Elizabeth and her father are dragon keepers, or Dragon Friends.  They have the ability to hear and interact with dragons, and to care for them. They have a ferocious Wyvern named Longbourn who lives in a cavern on their estate.  He is somewhat of a martinet and quite spoiled, demanding a lot of Elizabeth's time and attention. He has decided that she must marry Mister Collins, the estate's heir, because it will keep Elizabeth at Longbourn and forever under his scaly thumb. as in canon, Mister Bennet is Mister Bennet: whatever makes his life easier, he will do, and forcing Elizabeth to fall in with the dragon, Longbourn's plans is all part and parcel of his personality.  He can be a loving father unless it interferes with his wants and desires, and then he becomes selfish.  What he wants, as usual, is to live his own life without much care for anyone else's.  I liked it that Maria has brought out that aspect in his personality, because too often we don't consider him for what he is.  He and the dragon, Longbourn, are well suited to,each other, because they are both selfish, demanding and incapable of seeing anyone's viewpoint, but their own.  The estate dragons are always named after the estate they live on.  There is also a Pemberley dragon and a Rosings dragon, and the dragons are much like their Keeprs.  There is a treaty between humans and dragons that also dictates aspects of their interactions, and because of that treaty, the estate dragons can run their Keeper's lives.  Longbourn is insisting on Elizabeth marrying Collins, just as Rosings insists on Darcy marrying Anne de Bourgh.  And you thought Lady Catherine was the only dragon in P&P.Darcy has a dragon egg that is about to hatch, but it is stolen from him by exactly the one person you would guess!  He sets off to find the egg and in the process goes to stay with Bingley at Netherfield.  The story pretty much follows canon and also branches off into pure fantasy.  This is an exceptionally well crafted story with amazing creatures, whose personalities are just as big as they are.  The dragons all have very distinct personalities and their interactions with their Friends and Keepers are just plain fun and fascinating.  In this book, Mary and the Gardiners all can hear dragons and interact with them.  I loved reading about the Fire dragons, tiny bird like dragons. They reminded me of my conure, who also is smart, funny, a bit manipulative, and who also has a very annoying habit of biting!Elizabeth and Darcy have all their preconceived notions of the other playing out against a background of dragons and a fascinating universe.  Each dragon has it's own likes and dislikes, some get along, some don't.  They were almost like people - big scaly people, but people all the same.  The plotting and writing are excellent, and Austen's familiar words and story are skillfully woven into a big, amazing fantastic tapestry.  Like all of Maria's stories there is an interesting premise, familiar and new characters, snappy dialogue, and a healthy does of snark.  It was incredibly fun to read.Elizabeth and Mary are designated as Friends, Darcy and Bennet are Keepers.  Bennet wants to retire because of infirmity and an overriding interest in scholarship and dragon lore, which means Elizabeth is going to be named Keeper.  It is in Bennet's and Longbourn's selfish interests to keep Elizabeth tied down to the estate and the dragon.  Changes however are in the air, and long held dragon beliefs are falling away.  Dragons are beginning to understand humans better and are realizing that that they need to loosen the reins a bit. It is hinted that the new treaty with the dragons will cede the humans more control of their own lives, with less input, and interference from the dragons.  Once the treaty is signed, Mister Bennet and Longbourn can no longer dictate who Elizabeth will marry.  So it is in their interests to force her to marry Collins.  I kept hoping that he and/or Wickham would be eaten by a dragon, but so far, no such luck.  This is the first in a projected series, with the second book set to launch in early 2017.  I am completely hooked, and I will buy all of them and take this fantastic journey along with our much loved old and new characters.  I honestly can not say enough good things about this book.  It is engaging, fascinating, witty and breath taking.  Mind. Blown.  Even if you aren't into fantasy and sci-fi, give this book a chance.  I certainly am not, but Maria made a believe ever of me.  A lot of us dislike a story that plays out over several books, but for this to be one book would have made for a huge download.  I like that there will be some different stories and adventures, and normally, I would be the first one to complain.  This book has given me a lot to think about, and it had some laugh out loud moments.  I am glad it has ended for now, because we are getting our house ready to sell and I can't keep stealing away with my Kindle for hours at a time! "

She can often be found by a sunny window with a cup of hot tea and a book in her hand. She writes romantic comedy and comedic drama. You can find more information, short stories, and outtakes at www.EAdamsWrites.com"," I started this book and didn't like it. I put it down. After reading the other two unusual tales' books, I tried this one again with success. I didn't like it as well as the other two, but the creativity and imagination are all there-- still five stars. "," I loved the concept of the soul mark!  You’ll enjoy reading this light happy story if you are good at suspending your belief as it is something of a fantasy. There is very little tension in this story so you can sit back, relax and be happy as you read how all the Bennet sisters meet their matches. I especially enjoyed finding out what their marks were and the memo t when Elizabeth and Darcy realize they are soul mates. I would have loved to learn more about Mr. bonnet’s situation and spent more time with the other sisters. "," This was an interesting take on the soul mark trope. In this variation, everyone can choose whether to get a soul mark or not when they're thirteen, and the author discusses various factors that can impact their choice to get one, or not. If your ambition is to marry for wealth and status, you wouldn't necessarily want the Fate to pair you with a random poor person. You would likely be happy with your soulmate, but if you never find that person you might get sick and waste away. If you marry without a soul mark there's a very good chance that it would be an unhappy marriage, especially if one of you gets slapped with a soulmark after you married someone else for other reasons. Then it's possible that you wanted to have no soulmark, but your soulmate chooses to get one and you get saddled with a fated partner against your will. What's the ethics of that sort of thing, taking away their free will to choose their life partner?So I liked the whole thought experiment and the various ramifications and how it might go wrong.The romance between ODC could be more, well, more. The soul mark thingy makes it a done deal and something they both take for granted so even if young Darcy wasn't happy when Elizabeth stamped him with an itchy soulmark he is pretty happy to find her eventually. It's just a matter of finding out their marks match and none of the usual tug of war applies here.Minor editorial misses. "," This is the second of this series I've read. Couldn't put it down loved all the characters. Especially loved Lydia and her growing up. "," I liked this book from beginning to end. I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I wanted to love it but I didn't like how it ended so abruptly. So mean loose ends "," To really enjoy this book, the reader must be willing to suspend their practicality. This story has a significant similarity to fairy tales like those of Hallmark movies. It also helps if you have romantic tendencies as my husband claims that I do.With that acknowledgment of my personality, I admit that I found the ending and especially the epilogue very rushed and lacking development of the relationships of the ladies other than Jane and Elizabeth. That’s mostly my “hopelessly romantic” side giving that critique. * Spoiler alert* Not learning about Mr. Bennet’s situation was a significant disappointment. Ms Adams provided a couple hint but never finished the tale. *End spoiler*This book - and the entire series - are recommended for readers with willingness to suspend belief and indulge their romanticism. It should be read when one is in need of a lovely feel-good story. It will not disappoint. "," Most soul mark stories are quite similar in nature but this one is slightly altered. Instead of just a name or initials appearing these are actual drawings which occur after the individual is 13.  At 13 the girl can go through a service in her Church and accept her marking which comes after that. Many in the highest society refuse theirs because of several unusual matches - a peer with a maid for example!  Mr Bennet received his mark after the birth of one of his daughters and it wasn't the name of Mrs Bennet!  She had refused hers so she could find the wealthiest man to marry... It lead to 2 individuals unhappy with each other.  Elizabeth received hers and its a huge rendering of Pemberley and its grounds. Jane has one with a house and Charles Bingley's initials!The images of these marks make the story more interesting along with the entire family and friends hunting for the matches for each girl. One benefit was no attention from Mr Collins since he was without any marks! "," This variation hinges on the premise that people find their soulmate and/or partner in life on the basis of a mark on their person they choose to receive. That element makes the story a fantasy, although the “mark” can be an allegory or comparison to a person’s destiny or fate.As much as Fitzwilliam Darcy detested receiving a mark due to Elizabeth Bennet’s choosing to be marked at age 13, he gradually warmed up to the idea of spending the rest of his life with this captivating lady from Hertfordshire even though he was not aware of their identical marks. From then on, there wasn’t much angst between them.All the other characters received and “found” their marks all too conveniently.  Everybody of import got their happily ever after, which further contributes to this variation’s fantastical quality.  As long as they discover they have identical marks, the men and women of P&P found their destinies without much conflict or angst.Three and a half rounded up to 4 stars, for food writing and originality.  The lack of angst caused the deduction as it got too conveniently easy for the couples. "

I have one daughter. When she was in high school, her English teacher became my greatest encouragement, and I enrolled in college to become a teacher. I majored in both English and History, enjoying both. I have a masters in teaching and a second masters in Library Science. As a child, I loved telling stories, the more outlandish the better - at least I thought so. Now I am writing stories to share with others. I currently have between 10 and 15 rough outlines for stories, some P &amp; P variations, and some original stories. I also enjoy drawing and painting, so I create my own covers. I am playing around with a book about Elizabeth as a child, writing for a younger audience, and I want to draw the illustrations for the book. This, though, is a work in progress and will take some time. I currently write more as a hobby than as a profession - just because it is fun. I love to read, and over time, I have read many classics including War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, Dante's Inferno, and many of Shakespeare's plays. Only recently did I read Pride and Prejudice. It was the A&amp;E version of that peaked my interest. I believe it was my interest in reading, even as a child, that sparked my interest in writing. I currently have a number of stories published on fanfiction.net, but they are Twilight and Labyrinth stories. If you wish to see more about my work, visit my website at https://deborahannkauer.weebly.com/."," I enjoyed this book very much. Darcy was wonderful, as was Elizabeth. I thought Bingley needed a backbone and Jane was just too naive, even after all the evil she had seen. Hope, the baby, was adorable and it was fun to see how everyone interacted with her.  The villains of the story got their just desserts, finally. I would have given this story 5 stars but for the lack of decent proofreading. There were many errors, and in several cases, they interrupted the flow of the text. There were spelling errors (her shinning eyes), wrong word errors, (his finance), missing word errors, subject/verb agreement errors, subject/pronoun errors, homonym errors …and so on. I hope the author will get a better proofreader for her next book so she can show her creativity and storytelling skills to their best advantage. "," I never knew five hundred plus pages could pass so quickly and interestingly. Yes, Darcy and Elizabeth become friends and more early on but keep it as a secret arrangement. They become attached to each other as well as to the illegitimate child of Anne de Bourgh and Mr Wickham. Anne had married someone with enough clout to thwart Lady Catherine during the pregnancy. He even claimed the little girl as his. Still Anne makes Darcy promise to raise the child along with his own after he marries someone who will love HIM and her Hope. In Elizabeth he found someone who loved Hope, but did she, could she love HIM?Miss Bingley wants to marry Darcy herself and is willing to compromise him to achieve that goal. Oops, he's already married by that point. Plan B, get rid of the current Mrs Darcy and that child, then he'll be free and ready to marry Miss Bingley. Nothing can go wrong with that plan, could it?Nicely paced and intriguing throughout BUT the editing errors ARE ANNOYING!!! They are also 'to numerous too ignore'. Yes, that is similar to one. There are many others but it is over five hundred pages. "," Completely different tale than P&P but the characters are the same and well realized.  The writing is very good, the dialog engaging without being overly wordy.Darcy becomes the caretaker of Anne deBourge in spite of Lady Catherine''s insistence that she must be the mentor to the next owner of Rosings.  Anne, however, has crafted an ironclad will believing Lady Catherine would not want the child and indeed might kill the child.  On Anne's passing he introduces the girl named Hope to his family.From here Darcy decides it is past time he found a wide and that the London Fashionable ladies, after five years of looking do not have what he has been looking for.  Once he meets Miss Bennett in Meryton their progression is predictable though it doesn't go smoothly.  I don't think that surprised anyone.Me Later has crafted a really original and entertaining plot.  Thourghly chsrming.  Recommended "," I enjoyed this variation, but....This story had a lot to offer readers. It is rare that I see a Wickham redemption story that I  agree with. So thumbs up for that! I liked the connection between Lizzie and Darcy. I also liked how Lydia and Kitty were handled.On the other hand, I really wasn’t a fan of the Jane and Bingley characters in this version. They were a little too wishy-washy for my taste. Nobody is that nice or that naive. I really wanted Jane to see how weak Bingley was and to find someone else but, nope. She was just as clueless as he was.I gave this book three stars because of the excess of details that did not add to the story. For example, the detailed descriptions of how to get through the garden maze and into the hidden garden.- 2 lefts, 3 rights, 2 rights....ugh!  I was really hoping that this information would have become a key part of the overall story. Picture it!  Lizzie and Hope running from their abductors and it is only Lizzy‘s knowledge of this garden that would be their saving grace. But nope, just another bit of inconsequential information to make this book feel a little too long.Overall, I stuck with the book because I did enjoy the story. While I was a little distracted by a lot of the spelling errors and while I was a little exasperated by the additional unnecessary information,  I didn’t feel that it was a waste of time to read. "," This is a story of Mr.Darcy and Miss Elizabeth Bennet at their best and  Lady Catherine and Miss Bingley at their very worst.  Arrangements  are made . Some known and others unknown,  some helpful and others anything but. If this sounds confusing , don't worry,  you won't be when you  reach the end. You'll find yourself smiling.  Enjoy! "," Originally, I wrote the following, ""I give this 2 stars instead of 1 because I liked the initial concept. Unfortunately, the lack of editing was a major problem. There were intrusive typos, but the biggest frustration were the moments that seemed that the author forgot a character's name (Winston to Wilson and back again) or forgot that conversations and scenarios had already been had or mentioned. Characters seemed to forget that they already had certain knowledge.There were some likeable interactions, but they were overshadowed by the editing issues.""Update: I went searching for a favorite moment regarding Caroline Bingley getting her comeuppance (It's amazing what one can choose not to see until you walk in on it). I was surprised that it was in this book. I reread a lot of it, and was shocked I had been so harsh in my earlier review. It was a really good story. I admit there were a few plot holes/easy fixes, and I stand by the fact the editing issues were too abundant, but E&D's relationship was mostly well-written. They were given a lot of time together once their characters met. Their declarations of love to each other could have been more sentimental, but their interactions displayed it. I wish there had been slightly more story prior to the epilogue. It would have been nice to see if Elizabeth's visions of the future were manifested. The epilogue also seemed to end abruptly. (I don't think wanting more is a bad thing, but then, neither is wanting more editing.) "

I confess I enjoyed the tale of Richard's love of Anne more than I did Elizabeth's and Darcy's for theirs was expected and held no unexpected parts other than the impetus that drove them together. The fun changes made to Lydia's character were a delight, the contentment found in Jane's with her Mr. Bingley, and the comeuppance meted out to Wickham made the tale a pleasure, the kindly neighbor found in Mrs. Clay would be welcome in any society, I would imagine, but as Colonel Fitzwilliam needed his Anne more, it all ended most satisfactorily for me this evening. "," Enjoyable read that was well written and developed. A fitting ending for the villain Wickham, I'd say more, but don't like to read plot reveals in reviews. Enjoy. "," this story is just fun!  it is a tale of Anne de Bourgh.  even with all the comforts of Rosings, it had become her cage.  she longed for escape.  she longed for the freedom to become.  and Elizabeth Bennet would be her unknowing soundboard.  Anne's adventure would become more hide and seek with her mother, cousins Fitzwilliam and Darcy, and eventually Elizabeth Bennet.  but find her they would; and Anne would, in turn, find herself.  Read and enjoy! "," I found this to be an interesting premise; Anne isn’t as feeble and biddable as everyone thinks and Lady Catherine is almost nice (at least sometimes!)That said, it felt like there were a number of times when the language choice was a bit anachronistic (eg phrasing and word choices felt a bit too modern) and where a few scenarios weren’t very believable, which pulled me out of it.Not my favourite from these authors, but am happy that I can depend on these two for a quick, pleasurable, easy read - it was great for my lazy weekend day! "," Anne deBourgh is her own heroine in this P&P variation.  She is often portrayed as weak and  sickly.  But in this tale she is a tower of hidden strength.  She encounters Elizabeth Bennet on one of her rambles and a friendship ensues.  What comes from this forms the basis of this story as Anne rewrites her life as she takes control.  Familiar characters and situations are also a part.  But everything is from Anne's point of view. It begins when Anne runs away from home. Nuff said.  Read the book.  A fun read. "," Book was fun to read, but the plot and some of the characters so ludicrous that I had to deduct stars.  Very silly premise, and behavior of many main characters far fetched.  Seemed like Anne, Lady Catherine, even Elizabeth and Darcy, made to act almost cartoonishly weird just to advance some strange plot points.  The romance between Elizabeth and Darcy is nicely handled, in spite of the strange circumstances.However, these authors are talented writers,  and know how to develop their ideas.  The book is well written and well edited.  I recommend it, if you don't mind a lot of silliness. "," Well written if not entirely believable. Anne is probably too competent for someone presumably so sheltered and Lady Catherine’s plan seems kind of farfetched. Throwing together Darcy and Lizzy so publicly would risk the kind of talk Lady Catherine would surely not want. Wickham’s ending was satisfying.It’s not the best one I’ve read, but it was well-written enough to satisfy. "," Fresh plot.  Engaging characters.  Darcy and Elizabeth are their expected selves.  The stand out, unexpected personality of Ann caught me by surprise.  I loved it.  I laughed deeply and at length to some of Ann's comments about W.  The people of Meryton also had some choice comments about our usual bad guy.  Read this. One of those rare reads one wishes did not have to end.  The pragmatic Darcy in me classified this work as ""nearly perfect"" as nothing is ever flawless.  However, I found this book perfectly entertaining. "

She has adult aged daughters and an extended family that have supported and encouraged Renée in her writing career. Renée is an accountant and has been a voracious reader all her life. "," 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 stars, 377 pages on my Kindle.The title does not fully indicate that with ""He"" having a secret betrothal that there must also be a ""She"". Neither knows of this as the contract between their fathers is written so that it will only be revealed when ""He"" turns eight and twenty in order to allow both the freedom to interact and even marry with someone else if that is where fate leads. If not they are to marry at this point.Yes, he is Darcy and when he learns of the contract between his father and his father's friend, Mr. Thomas Bennet he asks for time to woo her so that there is a chance they might develop warm feelings, respect and trust before entering a marriage neither desired. So much of this story is Darcy deliberately interacting with Elizabeth and becoming friends...and more. Georgiana is part of the story and, of course, there is Bingley, having leased Netherfield.It seems that 15 years ago while Mr. Bennet, Jane and Elizabeth visited at Pemberley for a relative’s wedding and stayed the summer. 13 year-old Fitzwilliam Darcy and 5 year-old Elizabeth Bennet spent time together and found amusement in their interaction. Their memories were good ones.As time goes on, once a year the fathers exchanged letters summarizing their child's life for that year and when George Darcy dies Alexander Darcy (who was in on the original idea of a marriage contract) takes over writing the yearly letters.So Darcy is allowed to read of Elizabeth's life, her traits, her accomplishments, etc. through the years as he has access to those letters. Darcy later also reads what is written about him through the years.There comes a point in the story when deception works its way into the relationship. Caroline Bingley and Lady Catherine are involved (separately) and Elizabeth is devastated.There is an epilogue. I enjoyed this story which had a premise I have not read elsewhere. At 377 pages obviously I have not touched on much of the story. I did enjoy how Darcy and Elizabeth remembered their younger days together and the teasing that Elizabeth brought to their friendship. Yes, there are misunderstandings and a little bit of an insult which are worked out. "," I appreciate stories with a focus on the relationship of ODC. This is one of those stories. It grows from a childhood friendship and childhood memories to a secret engagement and finally love.The story is easy to read, well written and hard to put down. The use of letters is clever, it ads to the story, the understanding of characters and relationships and last but not least gives an insight into mr. Bennet and old mr. Darcy, their appreciation for and understanding of their children.The characters are mostly according to canon. Miss Bingley is slightly over the top, which is probably necessary because of the lack of Wickham. He is mentioned, but does not play a major role.I recently read a post on ‘bad reviews’ on one of the fan fiction sites. Although I sincerely agree that there is a way to explain your opinion and it should never be deliberately hurtful, I do not believe in asking for only 4 or 5 star reviews. Yes, a review is a personal opinion and should be taken as such. But what would be the value of reviewing if all the reviews resulted in 4 or 5 stars or if all reviews only included praise? I for one would not review a story I did not like at all. And yes I did review stories which resulted in less than 4 stars.All that said, this is a 4,5 almost perfect 5 star review. A story that I would love to keep within my favourites, reread and reread again. Thank you for a very enjoyable read. "," I really enjoyed this read!  There are some laugh-out-loud moments, which makes it comforting!  There are moments of short lived anger/sorrow on Lizzy’s part, but it’s not an overdrawn moment.  It was a happier version of P&P than the original and that made it a very comfortable read!  It’s a light, loving tale and very worth the time it takes to read it!One thing that I wanted to mention is that we really see that both Elizabeth and Darcy are imperfect, and need to work on their faults.  We are all imperfect and have our faults.  They are worth working on so that we can all grow and learn to be better people! "," This is a cute, almost no-angst story.  Darcy allows his cousin and sister to help him woo Elizabeth in 4 weeks.  The great misunderstanding doesn’t happen until after the 80% point, and it’s resolved in mere pages.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching Darcy call in reinforcements and do his best to be interesting and romantic.  I would have enjoyed it much more had I not read the synopsis and expected misunderstanding around every corner.  A better synopsis would be something like, “Darcy has one month to win Lizzy’s heart before the revelation of their forced betrothal turns her away forever.  Can he woo her in time?”Also, it feels like this author reads a lot of fan fiction, but doesn’t do her own research.  Modern language aside, there is a big difference between a jig and a gig.  If this were the only instance of head-scratchy word choice, I would have thought it an autocorrect that wasn’t caught.  Sadly, they are sprinkled throughout.  I encourage the author to keep writing, but please immerse yourself in the history of the time period as you do.  Your books and your readers will both benefit. "," This story is different in the fact that Mr Bennet had made a marriage contract with Mr Darcy Sr when William was 12 and Elizabeth only 5 years old! If they were still single when she was 20 and he was 28 they were to marry.  Every year the fathers exchanged letters discussing what their child was doing.  Neither child was informed about the betrothal.... Only Darcy's uncle who is a Judge, the Matlocks, and then the Gardiners were aware... Not even Mrs Bennet knew.The only glaring error I caught was Darcy's writing a quote by Oliver Wendell Holmes but he's writing it in 1811 when Mr Holmes is 2 years old. His birthdate is 1809!  This should have been caught before publishing the story. "

This book has both so it can’t miss. My only quibbles: for some reason Darcy doesn’t have a London townhome in this version and stays with the Hursts! There’s no way the Master of Pemberly with ten thousand a year would not  own a house in London in any P&P universe so this seemed strange. Also, I missed Mr. Bennet who doesn’t appear at all. His sarcastic wit is fun even if he doesn’t do much to curb his wife and younger daughters’ vulgarity. Other than these points, it was an enjoyable read. "," This is a fun and short story.  Elizabeth saves a puppy and grows to love her which Mrs Bennet cannot understand- nothing new there as her character cannot understand much.  Darcy arrived at Netherfield with his ward.  A little girl abandoned by her mother and finds himself unable to understand the child’s emotional state until they come across miss Elizabeth’s dog.  The little girl and Dalmatian become fast friends.  There is a lot of miscommunication and malice by jealous people who add to the mix.I will say mr collins is a surprise, kudos to the author for making me laugh. "," Entertaining read. Well written, albeit with a few typos -- wrong words spelled correctly are somewhat hard to find, even for a proof reader.  Adding a dog and a child does take something away from the romance, which was mostly skipped over. No sexual tension in this one, rather stuck in the friends zone and concluded. "," This was quite the tale. An abandoned puppy and an abandoned baby make for a unique way for ODC to get together. We have our usual misunderstandings and bickering but with the added benefit of a babbling toddler and a sweet-natured, giant dog. Our villains do their best to keep them apart, but in the end they find their HEA (after some twists and turns in the road, of course.)Well done story "," I enjoyed this newest novel by Miss Abbot. I've read much of her prior work and will say the stories have gotten more engaging and closer to what I'd consider historical. In this one,  I felt bad for the dog and the child.  I liked the love story between Darcy and Lizzy which was again done well. However, if I had one criticism, it is that while I like the addition of the canine to the story, I would have preferred an older child, one capable of speaking more than a few phrases. Otherwise, well done. "," I'm a sucker for spotty dogs, and Daisy the dalmatian while not having a speaking role really brings joy to this variation. Our hero arrives in Netherfield with his goddaughter Isabella, a sweet but shy toddler who is quite withdrawn. A chance meeting with a large friendly dog who belongs to Elizabeth Bennet changes their lives.A sweet story, it's not all plain sailing for these two but the resolution works very well. A truly heartwarming tale (or should that be tail?!) "," If you like stories about animals, you will enjoy this one. Looking forward to book 2.  Can’t bet kids and dogs. "," One thing that really irked me was that no one seemed to be able to tell the sex of a Dalmatian dog. Has the author never seen one? They have short fur, so determining male or female is VERY easy. And these people live in the country, so they cannot be ignorant of the difference in a dog, even at 3 or 4 months old. But when Lizzy rescues the dog, they only know it's female because Charlotte ""heard that it was female"". And Darcy only knows it's female because of the name on the collar? REALLY? Too unbelievable for sure. I felt the whole male/female thing of the puppy was irrelevant to the story and kind of ruined it for me.OK, I got that rant out of my system. The rest of the book was pretty good. It was nice to see the romance growing between them, in spite of Miss Bingley and Wickham. Although, Darcy seemed pretty stupid about Miss Bingley. It was obvious that the infamous note to Elizabeth about her dog was never delivered by Miss Bingley on purpose, and no surprise that she had a hand in tying up Daisy outside in the thunderstorm.Not a bad read. It's hard to go wrong with cute babies and dogs! "

Whilst the unusual situation of Darcy's memory loss was frequently mentioned the circumstances surrounding its occurrence were not explored to any great degree. Furthermore, neither the characters nor the plot were presented in significant detail - only the surface of the situation was skimmed.

At times I had to read paragraphs several times to figure out what the author was trying to say  I also can’t believe how immersed in the Bennet’s lives Charlotte was. She was a bit too much of a hero for me. "," I try to find at least one book with few ratings a week to enjoy but this one caught my attention with the absolute differences! I thank the author for this treat for whish I would want to other ending. I also congratulate the author for reminding us that not all of Elizabeth's traits are wonderful when not tempered and that she can hurt someone she loves, in this case intentionally, but I applaud both the characters written in for their ever-expanding hearts and the loves they deserved! "," Beyond the novelty of a Pride & Prejudice Variation not being about Elizabeth and Darcy, one is introduced to complex pragmatic young woman.  As intelligent in her own way as Elizabeth, this Charlotte has means to debate Elizabeth to the betterment of both.  A thoroughly enjoyable read "," There’s many errors and referring characters by the wrong name. While it’s an enjoyable story, it needs a bit of editing "," I did like the story line and that the characters are true to the original novel. What I struggled with was how the novel was written. It would spend several pages on one topic but then rush through major events in two pages. Things I would consider rather major. "," Thank you Ms. Knight for the attention to two of my favorite characters of P&P.  I have always enjoyed the expansion of the characters who are involved with the main favorites.  That you gave the Colonel such a great position to find love was so rewarding.  Charlotte deserves the attention also.  Two more deserving characters are not found.  Thank you.  It was also enjoyable to look into the family structure of the Lucas'. "," Great plot. Some of the writing was rather verbose. I really liked Charlotte's character. Definitely worth reading. Will be on the lookout for more of her books. "," I love P&P variations, but this one of the best! Charlotte deserved better than Collins and this was a fun read. "

What had Elizabeth written about him?FITZWILLIAM DARCY IS ON THE VERGE of proposing to Miss Elizabeth Bennet when he happens upon her diary in a field of bluebells. Though he knows he should not, he gives in to the temptation to read it and discovers a perspective of himself he had never before considered. Not only does Elizabeth not reciprocate his love, she considers him arrogant, insulting and disdainful. Her reasons, to his shame, are not entirely unfounded. Properly humbled, Darcy must decide what to do—walk away from his beloved forever or make the effort to please a woman worthy of being pleased.ELIZABETH BENNET IS A FIRM BELIEVER in the value of first impressions. Mr Darcy made a poor one and his subsequent behaviour did little to improve upon it. Worse yet, he has had the audacity to read her personal diary without permission.NEVERTHELESS, MR DARCY’S VIOLATION of her privacy forces Elizabeth to reconsider many of her former prejudices against him. As a result, she comes to know herself, and him, better. Can Elizabeth forgive Mr Darcy all his trespasses and give him an opportunity to redeem himself?  Read more","Mary Smythe is a homemaker living in South Carolina with a rather useless BA in English collecting dust in a closet somewhere. Mrs Smythe discovered the works of Jane Austen as a teenager thanks to the 1995 BBC Pride and Prejudice miniseries featuring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and has since gone on to read everything written by Ms Austen at least once yearly, always wishing that there were more. She has been writing since 2001, but only discovered Jane Austen Fanfiction in the summer of 2018. Mrs Smythe has two adorably precocious children, one girl and one boy, and a husband who bears a remarkable resemblance to Mr Bingley (sans the spinelessness). "," I like that it was fate that Elizabeth forgets her diary and Fitzwilliam finds it. I like that the awful words were never spoken, though I find myself now wondering... what is worse? To hear words spoken in the heart of a moment? Or to read words dedicated to paper for all time? As I read, it seemed less awful for Darcy to read these words, but now that I think on it, perhaps it was worse.  Well-written variation. Too short, though the epilogue at least Carrie's us forward in time. "," Hard to believe, but our beloved but stiff and upright Mr Darcy actually reads Elizabeth's personal diary!  Can't say I blame him, since the author provides the perfect excuse, namely that after finding it, he drops it and it opens to a page whereon he clearly sees his own name in the text of the writing, and succumbs to his curiosity.  The story begins during Elizabeth's visit to Charlotte Collins at Hunsford parsonage.  Darcy has just made up his mind that he can't live without Elizabeth as his wife.  He goes to meet her for her daily walk, and startles her as she's making an entry into her diary.  Elizabeth has just been told by Colonel Fitzwilliam that Darcy is responsible for separating Jane and Bingley, so she's writing the latest in a long series of nasty observations about Darcy.  She accidentally drops the book in her haste to get away from him.As in the original P&P, Darcy is shocked to discover that Elizabeth isn't ready to fall at his feet, as he had thought.  Armed with the knowledge that he has gleaned from the diary, he determines to clean up the mess he's made about Bingley, and about Wickham.  However, he plans to return the diary to Elizabeth with a little surprise waiting for her inside.I love these variations wherein Elizabeth and Darcy have a clear understanding of the issues facing them, instead of the usual beating around the bush that usually goes on.  The diary spells everything out that Elizabeth would never dare to say in propriety-heavy Regency speak.  Darcy has it straight from the horse's mouth how much of a snob that he's been. It's very satisfying.The romance is lovely.  This is a swoon worthy Darcy, and a suitably humbled Elizabeth.  I like this version of Elizabeth that isn't so pig-headed as usual.  The book is well written and well edited.  I recommend it highly. "," At Hunsford Darcy finds Lizzy’s diary, which she lost, and reads it. Of course it’s filled with many reasons Lizzy dislikes him. The rest of the book is about Darcy seeing himself through her eyes and deciding he has changes to make. No nasty proposal here.The rest of the story is much fun to read. Especially noteworthy is Lizzy has to chase him a little since he rightly thinks she doesn’t like him much and doesn’t chase her as much. Something which we don’t experience in many variations. All in all, I enjoyed the story. "," I enjoyed how Darcy found out that Elizabeth actually despised him... before he proposed. Reading her diary entries on her encounters with and understanding (or lack thereof) of both Darcy and Wickham is nice, but the reply Darcy writes is really well done.There is a lag when Darcy is avoiding Elizabeth, but mostly it moves along and stays interesting. This is a faithful narrative. "," This was unexpectedly a good read. Before he can propose, Darcy finds and reads Elizabeth’s diary. He is horrified and then, Lizzy is horrified. I know other readers were frustrated that Darcy kept running away from Elizabeth after that. But that didn’t go on forever and it was cute. Wickham’s comeuppance was good and  the epilogue was great. Low angst, sweet story "," At Rosings, Darcy accidently finds Elizabeth Bennet's diary and ends up reading it. He is flabbergasted to discover Miss Elizabeth had never flirted with him even once – and far from expecting him to propose, she loathes him and has labeled him ""the last man in the world she would ever marry."" Crushed by the discovery, he writes a version of the infamous letter: on the two pages after her last entry, he tells her the truth about Wickham. The Colonel helps him return it surreptitiously, and Darcy escapes Rosings as fast as possible.Elizabeth is shocked by reading the truth the truth about Wickham, but finally accepts it. Darcy returns to Meryton to expose Wickham's back-handed dealings.Sunk in humiliation over his behavior, Darcy is determined to avoid Elizabeth. It takes a special effort by our heroine to catch her man, a rather fun change from the usual JAFF.The epilogue is cleverly handled, with the Darcys continuing their ""you write first, and I'll answer"" as an expression of their intimate trust in one another. "," An excellent variation by Mary Smythe! I really enjoyed this clever and well written version. I have a new author to follow and continue to enjoy! "," Rosings Park:  Darcy comes upon Elizabeth sitting surrounded by bluebells and realizes he has never seen such beauty.  Elizabeth flees to Longbourn and Darcy finds a book among the bluebells.  Thinking it is a novel or volume of poetry she was reading, he puts it in his pocket intending to return it to her that afternoon when he plans to propose.On his return to Netherfield, he removes the book from his pocket and drops it.  The book lands in the open position.  When he bends to pick it up, his eye catches on his name.  He realizes it is Elizabeth's diary and cannot resist wanting to see what she has said about him.6 "

Author","None","Y","8.99","203,257","2020-07-26","301","4.0","594","‘Pride and Property’ is a variation of Jane Austen’s ‘Pride and Prejudice’ which tells the story of the Bennet sisters after their lives are thrown into sudden turmoil when they tragically lose both their parents. In particular, it tells the story of what happened next between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy after she rejects his proposal of marriage.Women in the Regency-era were not given many choices for their futures, and Elizabeth Bennet has a great deal less options open to her when she considers how she and her sisters might survive now that their parents are gone and they are about to be evicted from their beloved home.But then Mr Darcy makes an unexpected offer which could save them all – though after their heated confrontation at Easter time, Elizabeth is more disgusted by his presumption and arrogance, rather than grateful for his intervention. Yet, as her uncle makes clear, with her family facing ruin and with no other options left open to her, Elizabeth is not about to be given much choice in the matter. Can she bring herself to accept such an uncertain future… a future which – despite what she feels about the matter – is set to involve the very stern and intimidating Mr Darcy?“I don’t understand why Mr Darcy concerns himself in our affairs in the first place!” she cried angrily. “What does he want in return?”“He wants you, Lizzy,” answered Mr Gardiner bluntly. “He has made an offer for your hand.”“How dare he?” exploded Elizabeth in a sudden outburst of rage – and too angry to remain still, she abruptly jumped to her feet and began to pace around the room. “I already rejected him! He knows this; I made it abundantly clear!”This story is approximately 92, 000 words long.

Elizabeth has just angrily refused Darcy's maladroit proposal at Hunsford, but must push it aside to deal with the many issues that have arisen. Will Mr. Collins allow the Bennet ladies to remain at Longbourn for a decent period to mourn? Is there any money to support them? Where will they go? Can they stay together, or must they be separated?When Mr. Gardiner tells Elizabeth that Fitzwilliam Darcy has espressed a desire to wed her, she is shocked and angry. She can only imagine he must want revenge upon her insulting him. But her uncle insists she face reality – she and her sisters must take advantage of any opportunity from now on. Impoverished and orphaned, they have little choice any longer. Still angry, Elizabeth reluctantly agrees to ""at least listen"" to the arrogant Mr. Darcy.Darcy must wage a cautious campaign to win over his reluctant maiden, even as he fights his own carnal desires towards her. This wait of one year's mourning period will lead both Darcy and the Bennet ladies to unexpected discoveries about one another.Elizabeth's anger seemed overwrought, especially considering how quickly she flips into relying upon him, then missing him when he doesn't visit Longbourn. I liked the changes in the younger Bennet sisters after their parents died, but we didn't get much detail on ""inside their heads"". "," A quality read full of pride, prejudice and romance. There's nothing particularly ground breaking here, but we all love a good forced marriage (or engagement) scenario. The story begins with the death of Mr and Mrs Bennet and the expected repercussions. When Darcy hears that not only are the Bennet sisters essentially destitute but also in constant danger of being evicted by the unfeeling Mr Collins, he tracks down Mr Gardiner and offers his help. The price, of course, is Elizabeth's hand in marriage. Elizabeth, who has already rejected him at Hunsford, is expectedly angry but doesn't have much choice but to accept him. And so she slowly learns to love him...as I said, nothing that hasn't been done before, but it's well written and the character development is excellent.Probably the biggest difference between this book and others like it is that it's a forced ENGAGEMENT scenario rather than a forced marriage, meaning that when ODC get frisky for the first time it's out of wedlock. Some readers might find this ooc, but I thought it was well done. The plot built up to it so, even though the act itself was impetuous, it didn't come entirely out of nowhere. It was also a good scene/set up.I also liked how the author portrayed Elizabeth's anger early on. I tend to shy away from books where Elizabeth is overly harsh with Darcy, but it was moderated well here. You could tell that everything she said to him was a byproduct of her anger/grief and that, once she calmed down a bit, she would become more reasonable and that's what happened. Also, Elizabeth's anger was reasonable considering the circumstances, which is more than some books can boast.I deducted half a star because, again, it's essentially the old forced marriage/engagement trope, even if it's well done. The other half was taken away for formatting issues, specifically the inconsistent indentation of paragraphs. It was occasionally difficult to tell where one paragraph ended and another began, which took me out of the story since I had to figure it out. Not a huge deal, but it should be fixed.Overall, I recommend. I also enjoy this author's other stories very much. "," Immediately following the disastrous proposal, Elizabeth received word that both of her parents had perished in a carriage accident.  For some weeks, the Bennet sisters were kept busy packing their belongings as Mr. Collins wanted them out of Longbourn as soon as possible.When Darcy heard the news, he approached Mr. Gardiner to ask for Elizabeth's hand.  Elizabeth was horrified that she was expected to agree to marry Darcy, but Mr. Gardiner was firm in insisting that the marriage would be in her best interests as he could not support his own four children plus the five sisters.This is a very good story with an interesting plot and our favorite characters.  Out of the ashes of their grief, the Bennet sisters work together to build their future.  I think any JAFF follower will enjoy it.24 "," I enjoyed this book. Good story. I felt the emotions in this book. There are a few things that are a bit ""different"" from most P&J variations ... But that's why every book is different ha ha.There was not much dialogue. It was mostly D&E thoughts. A lot of explaining but somehow It did not feel repetitive. Rather I saw a very through analysis of the relationship between ODC. I missed Mr. and Mrs Bennett, the Colonel and i even missed Caroline and Wickman.The sisters were there but not really there due to the lack of dialogue. But because of that they were less silly.The fact that D&E didn't wait until marriage to do the hanky panky was also very different. This is typically unlike ODC's principles but of you approach is from a passionate perspective, it's likely.Is recommend "," My initial reaction to this story was frustration with Elizabeth Bennet and her anger. She gets so invested in her indignation that there's nothing that Darcy can say or do that she doesn't take offense to.  Her family situation is dire..the girls are essentially destitute and Mr Gardiner doesn't have the financial resources or even living space for 5 more people. Her only saving grace is accepting Darcy.  Fortunately good sense ruled and her attitude begins to adjust.  I'm so tired of the angry Elizabeth in stories.  This story was better because it focuses on their thoughts and feelings rather than daily events. "

Her blog is http://www.melschertz.com"," This variation is at times tediously focused on details which are insignificant.  At times, ridiculous and silly, very convenient and contrived, this reader has misgivings about this offering.  Although, credit is to be given to the author for her thorough discussions, these parts however take away what is essential, which is the focus on the beloved couple.There is hardly any pride nor prejudice, and minimalangst for the beloved couple FD and EB save for the danger to the latter’s life.  Everything seems to be handed to them, which make them seem merely shadows of their Canon selves.  Mr. Darcy is rather dependent on his parents and other family members who are all supportive of Elizabeth and the Bennet Gardiner families. While Elizabeth is a weak version of herself which this reader didn’t really care for.Nevertheless, the story is intriguing enough for this reader, which raised her interest and prompt the 3 star rating.  Readers can only tell, given the typographical errors and somewhat amateurish phrasing, if they will be engaged enough to read through and finish this. "," Elizabeth meets Darcy when he comes to Netherfield but he's not the pompous disagreeable person in the classic. His parents are still alive and he has a younger brother too. Charles has more of a backbone especially when it comes to Caroline. Both he and Darcy are blunt with her about her chances of becoming a Darcy - less than ZERO chance of that happening!  Darcy falls for Elizabeth quickly and because he is pleasant she likes him too. She's living with her widowed father, Grandmother Gardiner, Jane, and her brother and his twin sister that aren't in the story.  Elizabeth is actually the niece of Mr Bennet, her parents are dead and her father was the brother of Queen Charlotte.  From there we have an insane man from Austria trying to find Elizabeth bc of her father and a group of men terrorising people for information and another group including Colonel Fitzwilliam hunting them and protecting Elizabeth.The only part I found confusing is Elizabeth wanting to release Darcy from their betrothal bc of who her father was. That is beyond comprehension bc her father was Royalty, legally married to her mother. You can't get better connections than that!  It's a fast moving story with a wonderful outcome for everyone including Caroline Bingley! "," This is almost more like a fairy tale. It isn't easy to pull off a JAFF where circumstances are drastically altered for one of the main characters. In this story, ODC fall quickly in love, only to discover villains may be after Elizabeth because she is not a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, but a niece who was passed off as the second daughter in order to protect her from the men who killed her father.As one reviewer mentioned, there are numerous errata; not just misplaced words but duplicate conversations. Also I had a very hard time with this Elizabeth, as she had a tendency to burst into tears quite often. That doesn't quite ""square up"" with the image most of us have of Austen's most spirited, lively, yet sensible heroine.Although there was a creative ending for Caroline Bingley, it was frustrating that we didn't get more detail into **how** she maneuvered herself into her position. The story simply skipped over any descriptions past Caroline considering her fate in a locked cabin in the middle of somewhere unknown, to her assumption of a new identity and marriage some years later. There's a great couple of chapters lurking in-between those two scenes, I would think!Many of the original P&P characters are dropped or altered, and a number of new characters are introduced. But we don't get much feeling of character development on any of them. It's more of a ""Perils of Pauline"" type of story, unfortunately.I think some fans will really enjoy this as Darcy's romantic and protective aspects are in full force here, so this story should please them. "," I found this story to be humorous at the right time, emotional with extremely low anguish, and with families that love one another no matter what. I loved how Mr Darcy's parents are alive and how the behave. I did not like how Caroline made out, but that's just me. I would recommend this for all to read. Well written and clean. "," To be honest, if this didn't have names we all recognized, I'd feel like this was an OF instead of a JAFF... Elizabeth was super weapy throughout it and Darcy was just too sweet. I don't know, it all seemed very ooc for me, and I struggled to get through it. Which honestly sucks, because I love the idea of the story.I don't know. It was ok, definitely wouldn't read a second time. "," The storyline was a perfectly fine variation, but the characters were mostly underdeveloped. The editor did not do their job on this manuscript and that gives it 3 stars. I am annoyed with myself that I somewhat accidentally I purchased this title. Examples of proofreading: peace when it should have been peaceful and similar misplaced or misused words; having the same conversation about sharing a bedroom twice while calling both conversations the first time they spoke of the matter.I wish amazon had an opposite action for following an author, such as do not buy from this author again or a similar list. "," Very out of cannon.  ODC fall in love on sight,  Darcy's parents and Bennet's mother are alive and wonderful.  Wickham  is barely mentioned,  Lydia and Kitty were never born because Mrs Bennet died delivering Mary and his twin brother.Caroline Bingley gets exactly what she wants,  making everyone happy in the process. "," This has a complicated plot with many of the usual characters either non-existent, altered, or barely heard from.  Elizabeth and Darcy meet and fall instantly in love.  They are both so saccharine I could barely stand them.  There are villains and — of course — Caroline, but they are almost a separate, over-the-top, separate story.  I think many will enjoy this one, but E&D just don’t do it for me here. "

Things might have remained secret if not for Mr. Collins shouting at Elizabeth, drawing Lady Catherine and others to the scene. Mr. Darcy was all calm and cool, stating that there was no real impropriety because he and Elizabeth are engaged. That's when things hit the fan, so to speak.One of my favorite quotes occurs then: ""In that moment, the absurdity threatened to consume Elizabeth. It almost tempted her to wander off and have a conference with the roses about this ridiculous situation."" I could just imagine!Charlotte was humorous and Mr. Collins was oblivious, which was just as funny in places. He had no idea how unhappy his dear patroness was over the engagement.

"," Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth were caught in  a passionate kiss while playing the game Lady Catherine instigated.This is an easy-to -read, short story with mature scenes between a married couple. There was hardly any angst except for Lizzy's feelings. I did like that Mr. Darcy was vey accommodating to Lizzy however, (spoiler) the story lack the courtship I usually look for in such stories. Just felt the romance was incomplete.Nevertheless, this is quick read for P & P (mature) fans.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review. "," While there was some witty dialog, much of it seemed out of place: Charlotte making fun of Mr. Collins right in front of him? No real character development and the characters' actions were largely unmotivated. It was also weak on historical accuracy: I don't think footmen would be carrying up a tub to a lady's bedroom and filling it for her bath; the tub would be already present in her dressing room, and female servants would handle its filling. Also, a lady would have had a maid assisting her with dressing for dinner. I received the ebook as an ARC. "," Everything happens so fast and TO THE POINT that it makes Darcy very much the rake and Elizabeth not so much as an innocent as Darcy declared…The reason that forces the couple to get married seems unconvincing but of their own lust and desire. The reason Lizzy refused LCD’s offer to release Darcy from the engagement seems more like lust and stubbornness instead of the rational creature as in the canon. The intimate scenes are short and the building up is a bit flat, which turns out only warm but not very steamy.And the LOVE claimed between the couple is expressed by word spoken instead of actions IMHO.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review. "," I really enjoyed the humor and steam in this book. It was low angst, and the attraction between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy leapt off the page. I also loved Mrs. Bennet's marriage advice. And Mr. Collins had me laughing out loud. "," This short work does not merit association with Jane Austin’s work in any way. Her writings were not centered on sexual acts, while the greater content of this is. Not acceptable. "

Author","None","Y","4.99","204,551","2017-12-20","686","3.6","101","Revised May 2019!This is a non-canon story of Darcy and Elizabeth who fall in love quickly and marry after Darcy makes several resolutions to change his life. This story takes a turn when Richard Fitzwilliam falls madly in love with Elizabeth as well and he is also determined to bring about many changes. The usual characters cause some trouble with plots to disrupt their lives but the trio is up for the challenge. Contains some violence and strong language.Generally low-angst for major characters and adult-themes. Reader beware: this is an erotica novel with sexual situations and polyamory theme.  Read more","Discover more of the author’s books, see similar authors, read author blogs and more"," Spoilers will be included (though someone else did spoil this for me ha)I will admit, this story isn’t for everyone. When they say erotic adventure, they’re not even kidding. And heed the warnings of “polyamatory theme.” I think I can only approach this with speaking of the content and then the writing itself. The story starts “innocently” enough: Darcy makes a decision to not listen to his family and his misguided sense of duty and will therefore follow his heart. Simple enough right? But then it gets a bit wacky and you feel like you’re Alice falling into the rabbit hole.When Darcy meets Elizabeth, they fall in love right away and court the next day and get engaged the next day. Very Linda Wells in the instantaneous love. And there’s definitely sensual times here; nothing I haven’t seen before. Even the love scenes after the wedding are nothing I haven’t seen.But then it gets weirder...Richard also falls in love with Elizabeth. Again, we’ve seen this triangle before. But he can’t seem to stay away. And as I’ve seen before, Darcy is possessive.....but then he allows Richard to be around. This is when we start to realize we’re not in Kansas anymore.Wickham at one point attacks the Darcy’s and Richard saves them. Annnnnd Darcy essentially gives his blessing for Richard to kiss Elizabeth. Like he can’t avoid the inevitable anymore.The more the story goes on, the more liberties Darcy allows. Really, he’s the saint of this story. One thing leads to another, and the next thing you know Richard and Elizabeth are sleeping together and Darcy is okay with it. HOWEVER (and I say this with an eye roll), Richard is not allowed to fully penetrate Elizabeth. The “womb” belongs to Darcy...for now.And oh yes it gets weirder....Darcy eventually joins in. Someone else posted about this so essentially I was anticipating this scene and the more I read, the more I was curious to how Darcy gives in. It was basically an accident turned porn. And eventually, the happy threesome make their own vows and all bets are off. Sooo, anyone surprised that Lizzy had 9 children? There was A LOT of sex. Once Elizabeth allowed Richard liberties with Darcy’s blessing, she became insatiable to say the least. Nymphomaniac may be more accurate.And yet, I was oddly fascinated. The author seems to have considered this most popular love triangle in JAFF and decided “hey..why can’t Elizabeth be with both of them?” And there we go! Did I enjoy this story and would I be willing to read this again? Yes. But...believe it or not it’s the writing that turned me off.Grammatical errors are not all of it. The writing was juvenile, with curse words more suited to this century. Every declaration of love from Darcy, Richard, or Elizabeth lasted like 2 pages of the characters saying the same thing over and over again. Many phrases kept being used again and again. Really, any conversation lasts longer than it needs to be. So this story is very long and it didn’t need to be. But for the price I was ultimately okay with it.As for the other characters, well everyone is sexed up it seems. Bingley is another rake, and Jane eventually realizes her husband doesn’t satisfy her enough. I’ll just leave it at that. The Bennets find love again, and maybe an heir along the way. Caroline Bingley is a harlot. Wickham and Lady Catherine barely made any noise. Mr. Collins does NOT end up with Charlotte, but his choice of wife is surprising. Really the way certain things conveniently were patched up were interesting.Some random notes: the deviant aspects of the story go a bit far for me in one respect. They make mentions of “buggery,” which involved a kind of penetration I loathe reading about. I won’t spell it out but you can maybe figure it out. That turned me off the story completely.So, if you’re brave enough, I say go for it. It’s unique to be sure. But it’s not for you if you can’t quite share Darcy and Elizabeth with another man. And it’s certainly not for the more prude of us. "," WOW!! WOW!! WOW!! WOW!! WOW!!Just WOW!  I'm the happiest for Richard.  I've always just loved him! Sometimes even more so than Darcy. "," This is a rather unusual variation inspired by Jane Austen’s classic novel Pride and Prejudice. Darcy and Elizabeth are happily married but Richard loves her too. Darcy slowly permits Richard into their marriage and bed. It’s lovingly portrayed but if the subject offends you this isn’t the story for you. "," First let me start with the confession that I love 50 Shades of Grey.  I read and reread 1 2 and 3 of the books and bought all 3 movies so I am not easily offended.  I like this author but not this book. Fast forwarded through way too many repetitive and unimaginative sexual encounter real and imagined. I will finish it to see how it ends. "," Suspend all thoughts of Pride and Prejudice except for character and location names. Then be prepared for smutty kinky sex and a lot of it. Like Fifty Shades it is not for everyone. If you don’t mind non canon and kinky sex, you will enjoy this one. "," The content is not for the shy and oh so proper but it is an interesting story. "," Ok... So for, as I was reading this story... I'm at 22% right now, but I wanted to get my two sense in... I found through my emails that I previous reviewed this story.Note: Yesterday, when I was searching through Pride and Prejudice Variations, I came across this book thinking it's a new story.  Release date states it's Dec 20, 2017.  No reviews... So what's someone to think?After I finish reading because I will, but so far I have noticed two differences... The format changed as one is reading it, it's on cheese cloth/gauze like paper and the other thing is that the scene with how Lady Catherine met her husband has changed... More tamed.  I liked the first version though...My first review:Customer Review4.0 out of 5 starsSomething I did enjoy reading....By Texas Dee on October 28, 2017Format: Kindle EditionThis is an adult theme story (XXX rated) of a Pride and Prejudice Variation and a long EPIC one at that. It started out a great read. It's a real page turner, gets you interested right from the start.Part 1, Darcy, before he meets Elizabeth, he's determined to put a stop to Lady Catherine and Caroline Bingley manipulations. You have all the characters with slight alterations in personalities. With the added adult theme, I found it an enjoyable read, especially when it came to Lady Catherine and Sir Lewis's relationship! She got what she deserved. You have Caroline and Wickham who are just as horrid. I found humor in a few places that made me chuckle out loud. The low-angst that was mentioned in the book description, was only in our dear couple...which was very low... like... non existent. It was love at first sight, for them both. Other than that, it was the usual catty Caroline and wicked Wickham. The author makes you get anxious at not knowing what will happen next with the villains in waiting and she seems to cover a lot.One thing, I did not care for the descriptions of all these men jacking off at the sight of Elizabeth in their sick heads. Yes, even cousin Richard! There is a lot going on in this story and the author hits on Mr. Collins, Charlotte, the sisters, Georgiana and even the Hursts... Marriages, births...she has new characters and villains.For part 2 of this epic triangle love story, I felt there was too much sex. Not all was bad just way too much of it. The story was good, but we didn't need to know all of it... from day to day it seems. And this part or maybe the whole story should of be named ""An Iron Will"" instead of Resolution and Determination. To be honest, I didn't read any pride or prejudice in our dear couple. There was however a bit in Richard thoughts.I have read so many different variations...Some following the canon with a little sex here and there...Some not following the canon with a bit of mystery...etc. So... would I recommend this to anyone...Sure if you're not a prude. There is a lot of other things going on in this story that made it very interesting. NO...there is really no pride and prejudice in this story it is a non-canon with lots of I love you's, descriptive sex scenes, murder plots, and a heroine and heros.Comment| 4 people found this helpful "

Author","None","Y","2.99","392,791","2019-11-22","304","4.6","176","George Wickham's childhood friendship with Lizzy Bennet saved his life. How will it change her future?Ten-year-old George Wickham was hungry, lonely, and desperate until the day he met Lizzy Bennet. She transformed his life with a peanut butter sandwich and the magic of books. Losing her friendship devastated him, until his meeting with the Darcy family set him on a course to a new life.Will Darcy insulted Elizabeth Bennet at their first meeting and accidentally injured her a few months later. She is just starting to overcome her first impression of him when something from his past comes to light. Will the revelation of Elizabeth’s childhood friendship with George Wickham change everything?""A Good Name"" is a clean modern variation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice,"" not a retelling. Is George Wickham born to be the villain, or can he be something more? At its heart, this is a Darcy & Elizabeth romance. This is a full-length novel of about 96,000 words.""You've never seen a George Wickham like this! I highly recommend this debut novel by Sarah Courtney.""--Melanie Rachel, author of Drawing Mr. Darcy  Read more","Sarah Courtney has been addicted to reading since she first learned how. She carried books with her everywhere . . . to sports games (professional sports games required two books!), school, bus rides and car trips, and even when her parents told her to ""go outside and play."" She finds time for reading now by doing most of it on her Kindle app, which means that she can read while walking down the stairs, waiting in line, making dinner . . .Sarah loves to read fantasy and fairy tale interpretations, Agatha Christie's mysteries, romantic suspense/action, and especially variations of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.Sarah tried her hand at writing numerous times as a child, but never stuck it out long enough to finish a book. When she discovered that there was an entire fandom dedicated to her favorite author, Jane Austen, she was inspired to write her first novel.Sarah homeschools her six children, ages three through fourteen (which means that she will now always have at least one teenager for the next . . . sixteen years!). She is constantly asked, ""How do you find time to write?"" The answer is simply that you find the time to do the things you love. Also, getting the laundry put away is highly overrated."," It's pretty amazing to come across a totally original idea for a P&P variation.  I've read so many very good JAFF books and this is one of the best.  A modern day version, wherein ODC meet as children, are separated for many years, and meet again as adults.  The situations of their lives are difficult, both having to overcome deeply troubling family circumstances. The author isn't shy about giving her characters huge obstacles, or about addressing issues that we maybe don't consider much in our lives.Although this is called a P&P variation, you won't find much resemblance to the original.  However, I can't object to the direction this story takes because it's so fascinating, the characters are so engaging, the drama is so compelling, the emotions are so poignant.  Although there are many very sad and challenging difficulties that Darcy and Elizabeth face, overall the story is uplifting, and spotlights the very many good and kind people to be found in the world.There were quite a few editing errors, mostly missing words, but not enough to be a distraction.  The book is well written, a great story, and I recommend it highly. "," A sweet, sometimes sad (I might have got teary once or twice), beautiful story. PG, modern, heart warming. I very, very rarely read P&P stories that start when ODC are children, but this one has me hooked from page one and all the way to the epilogue. "," This review contains a spoiler alert!I was enamored with the idea that George Wickham could have a different storyline from his typical debauchery and villainy, especially since we meet him as a vulnerable 10 year old. I wasn’t entirely sure how I felt about George Wickham and Fitzwilliam Darcy being the same person. At first, it felt like a travesty of our beloved Jane Austen’s creation that our very hero and his nemesis would be such since P&P itself never hints at any remorse or redemption for Mr. Wickham. But of course, this story is meant to be a modern version of the characters we so dearly love, and truly not in any way, another version of P&P. In that, this novel shines, and Sarah Courtney masterfully tells a heartwarming NEW story about the path to love these two people take. This is a lovely story, sweet, tender, and gracious. The names may be familiar, but the story is unique. I thoroughly enjoyed this book! "," An enjoyable ""what if"" with E and D moved to current times in the U.S., meeting as preteens with troubled families. They're parted for many years, but when they finally meet again, circumstances threaten to destroy D's family business and his reputation.It's a sweet love story, but really doesn't have much to do with P&P except using the names. Once one goes too far off canon, when the story bears little resemblance to the original, it's less a JAFF and more a story entirely different. You might as well take Erich Segal's 1970 ""Love Story"" and rename Oliver to now be Darcy and Jennifer to become Elizabeth. "," Elizabeth as a child meets a poor, hungry George in the park and spends the next 2 years feeding him and helping him read.  Unfortunately her family breaks up and she moved away while he lived poorly with his drug addicted mother until her overdose.Years later they meet but it's months before they realise who each other is.The story addresses poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, and it's effects on children. It's painful to read at times but 90% of the characters have good intentions! "," If you really don't like Wickam-centered  stories and prefer JAFF novels that dispose of his character quickly or ignore him completely (like me), DO NOT BE AFRAID!  JUST TRUST ME & READ THIS BOOK. I won't spoil it, but the major twist in this story is FANTASTIC and incredibly creative!! I very strongly recommend this book. This is a very well-crafted modern retelling of P&P. It's entertaining and clever and seriously pulls on a unique set of heart strings. Some wonky typos.  This was a really good Solid read. Don't ask too many questions. Just dive in! It's a sweet journey. "," Oh, I loved it! Read it as soon as it popped up in my kindle library.A Good Name had me from the opening lines—“It was Saturday, and George Wickham was hungry again.” It’s such a gentle story, just great for this time of year. It’s about finding friendship and love in unusual ways, and I adore that it all revolves around a love of reading.There’s also a twist that I won’t reveal here because who wants to read a review that does that??? I will just say that I’ve never seen it done in JAFF before, and it’s even better because there’s more to the book than the twist.If you’re looking for a low-angst (there is conflict but no agony, lol) lovely Pride and Prejudice-inspired novel with an HEA, then read this book. "," Another reviewer said she was hooked starting from the first line.  I, on the other hand, was nervous... Young Elizabeth befriends a Young George Wickham and I *liked* this Wickham.  And yet, I want my Lizzy to get her Darcy! But I liked this George and wanted a happy ending for him!  How on earth could I get BOTH?Don't worry -- I did!  (But I won't spill the secrets -- you'll have to read it to find out!)There are some direct parallels in this modern to the progression of traditional P&P, yet they are intermingled with some incredibly creative and imaginative twists and turns that keep me fascinated, wondering what would come next.

Upon his return two years later—while standing on the steps of St. George’s Church in Hanover Square—he spies the very woman he has vowed to forget.

Having spent years in the world of business, she is now content to leave it behind and concentrate on writing about Austen's characters finding true love in 19th Century England.

In her dream world, she lives in England in a place called Pemberley."," Accomplished author Jan Hahn’s latest Austenesque novel, ""The Child"", beseeches “can love overcome all, even the prejudice against a child born to an archenemy?” She writes just the kind of tale that lures me in, consumes me. In Hahn’s stirring re-imagining of Jane Austen’s ""Pride & Prejudice"", two years after Miss Elizabeth Bennet baldly refused his hand in marriage, Mr. Darcy beholds her from across a London street...with a young child in tow. A child! Whose child? But before he can approach her, he is called into the church: “I say, Darce, are you coming? ... The bride is waiting, Darcy!” Bride! Whose bride? Thus, within the first pages, I was addicted.Years have changed Darcy and Elizabeth since that ill-conceived proposal at the Hunsford parsonage and each has their own cross to bear. Darcy learns that while he and Charles Bingley toured the continent to escape heartache, the Bennets of Longbourn have been embroiled in scandal—the Wickham affair. George Wickham, his boyhood friend, now foe, had eloped with a Bennet daughter, abandoning her with child. Hearing the rumors, all fingers point to Elizabeth as the unwed mother. Yet, when the Bennets’ horse throws a shoe and waylays their carriage on the road to Hertfordshire, Fate intervenes, once again propelling Darcy and Bingley into the company of Miss Jane Bennet and Elizabeth. Offering to deliver the ladies and “the child” home, Darcy cannot but observe the interaction between Miss Elizabeth and Baby Fan:""Naturally, Elizabeth tended to the little girl, I observed she was a most proficient mother. How tender her touch and her tone as she petted and soothed the little one! Just the kind of mother I had envisioned her to be. I remembered dreams of old that had contained a child of mine suckling at her breast. Long vanished now, man!""Back in the neighborhood, the gentlemen see with their own eyes how even the four and twenty families of Meryton have shunned the Bennets. Gossips declare that Wickham is the father and Darcy is tested like never before—guilt, resentment, and pride clash with his enduring, unrequited love and his need to somehow, some way, restore the Bennets’ honor. How could she not have heeded his warning and eloped with the blackguard, resulting in these shameful consequences? Told in the first-person narrative through Darcy’s eyes, the warring between his sense and sensibilities is honest and intimate:""Abruptly, she withdrew her hand from mine. I realized she could not bear the shame of my disapproval, for I represented society, the same society that condemned her and her family. Our hypocrisy be damned! Neither Elizabeth nor her sisters should suffer the degradation Wickham had inflicted upon them.""Darcy knows Bingley can never marry Jane Bennet as long as the child remains in the Bennet household—a constant reminder of their misfortune and fall from grace—and he takes it upon himself to find Wickham and convince him to claim the child (read: bribery). Alas, nothing ensues as Darcy expects and he must disguise these machinations—and his yearning—or risk losing all he has ever desired:""Immediately, I realized how I had exposed my feelings. What in blazes had I been thinking? That was the problem—I had not been thinking at all. I had been caught up in the pleasure of walking with Elizabeth and basking in the delicious scent that wafted over me when we inadvertently stepped too close to each other.""Further, several beloved and anticipated characters from canon add color to this heart-stopping tale.I first discovered the elegant writings of “JanH” in February 2007 on-line at Mrs. Darcy’s Story Site. I inhaled all she had published on the Web and when she was posting her “work-in-progress” (WIP) on Sunday evenings, Sunday became “JanH Night” in my house—and soon after the dishes were put away, I was on-line, reading her latest installment. In 2011, she began posting ""The Child""; this WIP became my weekly high, my drug of choice. To my delight, seven years later, I find this tightened and edited version exceptional as anticipated, nay, as expected. Hahn’s absolute understanding of Austen’s characters, imaginative story, and adept research of the language and mores of Regency England create powerful imagery and emotive reading. I heartily recommend you read ""The Child"" sooner than later. But be warned, once you start it, you won’t be able to stop. You’ll find yourself at midnight swearing, “Just one more chapter. I can stop any time.” 5 stars. "," Written from Fitzwilliam Darcy's point of view, this story posits that both Darcy and Bingley left England after the abortive Hunsford proposal, never hearing about the scandal of Lydia's elopement with Wickham and how it devastated the Bennet family.When Darcy returns to England and sees Elizabeth Bennet with a little girl, he realizes he is just as much in love with her as he ever was. But of course, she hates him, and has gone on with her life. Hasn't she?Her reproaches have changed him, he thinks. But his reactions to her, and her family's, situation show that he is still arrogant and prideful, no matter how good his intentions are. Darcy has altered, but not enough to avoid angering Elizabeth with his autocratic lord-of-the-manor assumptions.This is one of the most unusual ""marriage of convenience"" stories I've encountered. And we get Darcy in full force here, trying to do the right thing, but going about it the wrong way. I wouldn't say there is a large amount of angst in this tale, but it's unusual in that we get a look into Darcy's angst as he tries to navigate a marriage that is not at all what he was hoping for.Very well-crafted and well-edited JAFF. Highly recommended for all Darcy fans. "," This is a great book that I thoroughly recommend. It is all from first person Darcy POV which was unusual at first but worked VERY well. To summarize the Bennetts are ruined Darcy and Bingley have been parading around the world to escape their sadness only to return and be thrown back in the presence of the women they love and now they are even less socially acceptable with the child. The story is not rushed, time passes in a logically manner and it is told with adequate detail and no sudden unrealistic occurrences. Darcy thinks he has learned his lesson regarding his character when he meets Elizabeth again but his meddling causes her and her family more problems and its later in the story that he realizes he had not really learned his lesson.  Despite his love for her which was very real he was still trying to manipulate all things around him with his money and position to suit himself. Elizabeth's rock solid character especially with the child is what was enduring. Here is Darcy trying to have this illegitimate child removed from the Bennett house hold thinking it will solve all their problems, Bingley can freely marry Jane and they would all be grateful to once again be marriageable. Wrong. Elizabeth will simply bend to the ends of the earth instead of leaving the child. She unknowingly ruins all of Darcy's plan which frustrates Darcy but he needs to know she is not one to be bent by all the superficial rules of society and if he wants to be with her (which he is powerless against his feelings) then he will have to take ALL of her. So respectable. Now that child! the interaction between Darcy and the little naughty child is entertaining and... mini spoiler- by the end of the book Darcy cannot imagine how he ever found the child unloveable! the CHILD won Darcy's heart as much as Elizabeth!  Despite his selfish intentions Darcy still proves to Elizabeth with his actions he is a good man.As a well seasoned reader of P&P variations it is nice to read a book that is a new story line, its not too easy on Darcy or Elizabeth, and its told to pace with appropriate detail.  ""In the wilds of Derbyshire"" is the first book I read from this author which was fantastic. I tried reading many others but they were too much on the bandwagon of  ""Elizabeth is perfect and everyone loves her immediately"".  As a matter of fact I had decided to discount this author due to the blandness of many of their stories. this story is a jump back into the quality of the author. "," Very entertaining storyline in this well written variation. Darcy and Elizabeth had to overcome much to learn to love one another and let others into their lives. Enjoy. "

Before she can read past the initial offer and the criticisms , Mr. Collins snatches it away and runs to gift it to Lady Catherine.  As you can imagine,  this is just the beginning  of a series of demands , heated  arguments , and a few unexpected  evictions.  Keeping all this to herself,  Elizabeth  returns to  her Uncle's  home in town , where she tries to reconnect with her beloved older sister,  Jane. Hang on tight , it's going to be in  for a bumpy ride. Enjoy! "," Darcy writes a letter to Elizabeth - not a rebuttal of her charges, but a proposal letter. If anything, his insulting remarks about her family seem even worse in writing than if spoken! Unfortunately, Mr. Collins intercepts the letter before Elizabeth can finish reading it, and gives it to Lady Catherine.Darcy's aunt does exactly what one would expect: she threatens Elizabeth with ruin, and tells Darcy he must marry Anne. Darcy also tries to reunite Bingley with Jane Bennet. But Elizabeth and Mrs. Gardiner are dismayed to discover Jane refuses to accept Mr. Bingley as a suitor again. Bingley is so discouraged, he decides to give up and leave London.Will Jane and Bingley be reconciled again? Or will Lady Catherine's threat to ruin not only the Bennets but the Collinses as well, succeed in destroying everyone's happiness? "," Fun reading. I enjoyed the characters, but the letters' consequence got tiring. Eight more words are needed for this review. "," Somewhere towards the beginning there were a few spots where it lagged a little bit, but then, I had to force myself to go to bed in the wee hours of morning. I very much appreciated the interplay between the characters, and loved Lord Matlock! "," Darcy decides to propose on paper but things go sadly awry when Mr. Collins intercepts the letter. Lady Catherine threatens to use it to blackmail Darcy into marrying Anne and throws Collins out of the parsonage. Elizabeth has plenty of options in front of her, as she could either marry Darcy, the Colonel, or be ruined. In the meantime, Jane is doing her best to prove to Mr. Bingley that she never cared for him. I loved this and finished it in one sitting. Well written, has great dialogue and a pining, hopeless Darcy who is still determined to protect Elizabeth to the best of his ability.Steam level: kissing. "," Really enjoyed this variation. The plot was different and had an twist that I enjoyed exploring.  Some parts were stretching it, but it didn’t impact the overall enjoyment. "," So good! I could not stop reading. Loved this story from beginning to end. Started off disastrously for Darcy and Elizabeth. Ended in perfection. The story was suspenseful in that it kept me engrossed the whole time. Highly recommended! "

I will not thank you for providing us with a home, nor will I even breathe a word of gratitude for your provision of such funds as will feed us each quarter. I will not even write such platitudes as ‘You are very good,’ given that you have also provided us with respectability in the form of Mrs. Ingles. There. I am quite done now with not expressing my gratitude – I should not at all wish to prove tiresome.”From the author of Tact, Dear Nameless Stranger is a heartwarming tale inspired by Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice and Jean Webster’s Daddy Long Legs. Tragedy has struck the Bennet sisters but they are greatly relieved when the anonymous kindness of a stranger means that they can remain together. In exchange for such charity, a monthly letter is required from each sister. It is a fortunate thing that Miss Elizabeth Bennet rather likes letter-writing, for she relishes the opportunity to relate to this unknown gentleman all her impressions and opinions regarding her changed circumstances.With each passing month Elizabeth confides more in the nameless stranger, and by the time Netherfield Park is once again occupied by the amiable Mr. Bingley and his friend Mr. Darcy, she is quite frank in writing of her dismay.   Read more","Jeannie Peneaux is a thirtyish-year-old mother of three and wife of one. Jeannie is an easy sort of person to please and likes reading, writing and cooking-- particularly when the cooking involves cake. A good evening involves chocolate cake and a thick book."," (spoilers) I enjoyed this story very much! The Bennet sisters are suddenly orphaned shortly after Lizzy's return from Kent. Mr. Darcy  learns in a letter from Lady Catherine that Mr. Collins has inherited Longbourn and cruelly turned out the Bennet sisters, based on Lady Catherine's mean-spirited advice. Appalled at this, he anonymously purchases a house for them near Meryton and provides an annuity and a governess/companion to give them respectability. Their ""payment"" is that each of them has to write one letter a month to their benefactor.In the first part, we have letters (mostly from Lizzy, but some from the others) to the Nameless Stranger who is their benefactor. The author has shown each sister's personality very well. I especially liked Kitty's surprising nature as exposed in her letters. It is all very cleverly done, and fun to see the different viewpoints of each sister as the months go by.The second part is not letters (though some we didn't see in the first part are shown), but is primarily written from Darcy's point of view, starting from his sorrow over Lizzy's refusal and then learning of her parent's death and how he deals with it.Parts of it were hilarious and parts were quite moving. I do love a book that can have me laugh out loud and also shed a tear or two here and there.I have to knock off 1/2 star though, for the way it ends. We need an epilogue with more closure on the story: I want to have it at least continue through the wedding and move to Pemberley. I want an answer to what is up with Charlotte's silent acceptance of Mr. Collin's cruelty - not to mention how he tries to claim the role of benefactor to the Bennet sisters! He needs to be squashed more than he was by Charlotte's parents and Darcy, and I want to wallow in the schadenfreude of his downfall! Mr. Darcy needs to get the family portraits from Longbourn for Lizzy and her sisters. Also, there was something about Mr. Bennet's will or other legal matter that was mentioned in Darcy's last meeting with his lawyer Mr. Briggs; he was to meet with Mr. Gardiner about it. None of this was answered or described, which makes me curious as to why it was even in the story at all.Overall, though, a very good story and I recommend it. It was also fairly well-edited, which I appreciate! "," I'm not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said other than this is an adorable read! There were moments that I laughed out loud and others when I was holding back tears.The Bennet sisters are orphaned when both parents are killed by disease. Mr. Collins writes to inform them that he will not offer them any aid nor allow them to stay on at Longbourn. To the rescue comes a letter saying that an anonymous benefactor has provided a cottage, yearly funds, and a companion in Meryton that the sisters might stay together. His only requirement is a monthly letter from each of them informing him of how they are doing though they are forbidden to write their thanks.The first half is almost entirely E's letters to this kind Nameless Stranger detailing their lives and eventually confessing her love for Mr. Darcy. Oh, guess who the anonymous benefactor is? I loved when E quipped about marrying the next man to offer and they recieve a letter stating none of them can marry at present. That made me laugh.The second half is from Darcy's perspective and you get to read some of the other sisters letters. It's very heartwarming and cute to get inside these lesser characters heads and watch Darcy learn to appreciate them and come to love them as sisters.Sometimes the second half got a tiny bit hard to follow when he would talk about something in E's letter but you weren't provided with it. If I had a hard copy it would have been easy enough to flip back, but I read this on my kindle. Even still, the author offered at least a little bit of context that I was mostly able to infer the meaning. E's letters were not rewritten in the second half at all, which is understandable.Ive read two of Jeannie Peneaux's works and I loved them both (this and Tact which I purchased after reading). I found it interesting that she makes you really like Collins in Tact, but utterly loathe him in Dear Nameless Stranger. I'll be pleased to read any if her other/future works! "," This bit of Jane Austen fan fiction was an absolute delight. It takes a common feature of Austen -- main characters writing letters to each other -- and creates a lovely variation.This contains two novellas -- Dear Nameless Stranger and An Unfair Advantage.Because it is JAFF and one of the rules of JAFF is that Elizabeth and Darcy always come together, you already know the ending. The delight is how they come together.In this variation, Mr and Mrs Bennet had suddenly contracted a severe illness and have passed away. The Bennet sisters are left to struggle on their own. Mr Collins has sent them a rather vicious letter letting them know he will not take care of them in any way. However, a nameless stranger has offered them a home in Meryton with a yearly sum of 400 pounds, as well as a respectable companion. All that is required of them is that they write their benefactor letters each month. Dear Nameless Stranger is from Elizabeth's viewpoint and is her monthly letters. You get to watch her as she eventually bares her heart to this nameless stranger, as she comes to terms with her own feelings and emotions.An Unfair Advantage is the same story from Mr Darcy's point of view.I loved it. I absolutely loved it. After reading the two novellas straight through, I went back and read them again, switching between the stories to read the chapters in sync with each other.There is a lovely poignancy to each, as well as growth and maturity to each of the characters as the months pass.It is truly a lovely bit of fan fiction and I hope to see more at this level from the author.I would also love to hear an audible version from a good narrator!

I thought it well written, and I thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue and interaction of ODC.  However, the premise on which Elizabeth based her rejection of Darcy seemed far-fetched and ridiculous to me.  Her thoughts on the matter annoyed me so much that I almost stopped reading.  Luckily, the aspects that I enjoyed allowed me to continue and complete the novel with an HEA. "," This was a nice quick read with a little angst.  It was also nice to get a bit from both POV's "," A novel twist with Darcy being young Elizabeth's Crush after 2 trips to Pemberley with the Gardiners.

After the compromise situation a faux engagement follows so as to avoid a scandal that would affect the sisters. This is a novella that could be fleshed out with more character interactions including the surprise Mary and Col. Fitzwilliam romance. "," This story isn't as interesting or exciting as most. Darcy and Elizabeth get stuck together in a cave after cave-in while touring it with the residents of both Longbourne and Netherfield. They don't get rescued until the next day and of course its a compromise. Collins decides she's a fallen woman and berates her until Darcy steps in to propose.  They have met before now at Pemberley during 2 different tours with the Gardiners and at age 14 she fell in love with him!

About the only ones not having trouble are Charles and Jane!  Its nothing earth shattering ...just a few weeks in Hertfordshire. "," Lizzy and Darcy are trapped in a cave so they might have to marry. I didn’t enjoyed the coming together because I thought Lizzy wasn’t seeing Darcy accurately.

A steadfast cheerleader, prolific commenter and opinion-giver, sometimes headstrong and obstinate — especially when defending Darcy, who in her eyes can do no wrong — she has made a lot of friends among JAFF authors and keeps in contact with many of them.

"," A lovely and sensible book. No eye rolls from me- sometimes I think there should be ratings based off how many times you rolled your eyes while reading 😄What I liked:-Plenty of Darcy and Elizabeth.-Darcy and Elizabeth were reasonable.-They didn't sabotaged their budding romance by  overthinking every statement or action.-Love the dialogue.-Balance and true forgiveness. They equally shared the blame for past behavior. No one was brow beaten. No one appeared better than the other. They were on equal footing.-It's always a surprise when there is a Mrs. Bennet that I actually like. Yes, she was a bit silly, but not over-the-top ridiculous. Her reaction to Elizabeth's engagement was perfect.-I like the conversation between Mr. Bennet and Elizabeth concerning Darcy. Shame on Elizabeth for teasing her father that way😂-A small dose of the Bingleys and Wickham.-No Collins or Lady Catherine.Georgiana is sweet, but like Elizabeth, I wanted to shake her. "," I would have enjoyed it more if Elizabeth spent less time beating up on herself for her behavior to Darcy and her original liking and trust of Wickham. Elizabeth never seemed able to forgive herself and move on. For much of the book it left this reader with a feeling of a much less confident Elizabeth than readers are used to from the original P&P and took away from the story.An epilogue while not absolutely needed given the story, would have been appreciated and helped make the book feel more complete.It does not make my favorites list, but I still definitely recommend this book. "," The story begins after the Hunsford proposal as both Elizabeth and Darcy are licking their wounds.  Mrs. Bennet unceasingly berates Lizzie for refusing Mr. Collins, but Lizzie's reprieve is traveling north with Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.From Lambton, the Gardiners decide to visit Pemberley.  After determining that Mr. Darcy is not in residence, Lizzie agrees that she would like to see the house and grounds.  While they are admiring the gardens, who should appear but Mr. Darcy.  Will he make himself scarce or ask them to leave?4 "," Well written variation for our favourite couple. Interesting treatment for the secondary characters -- Wickham getting better treatment than he deserved after a second attempt of manipulation. I agree with Col. Fitzwilliam, might have been better to shoot him. Bingley and Hurst improved also in this variation. Enjoy. "," This variation is close to perfect, although a bit towards the sensual-dramatic side.  Still, every bit of it is just about everything every fan of JAFF craves for, especially that element of more Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet.There is also a tad of George Wickham and Georgiana Darcy but  they are instrumental in bringing the beloved couple more close and connected as in Canon.  The justification of Elizabeth Bennet’s change in affection and regard for Mr. Darcy and vice versa is quite palpable, even dominant in many parts. This reader feels that is what makes this one of the best P&P variations she’s ever read. Highly recommended! "," a lot of second chances (both positive and negative) in this P&P adventure.  Elizabeth and Darcy are the stars, of course, with a great supporting cast of the Gardiners, Bingley, the Bennets and Georgiana Darcy her teenage best!  do read this one.  it is an adventure worth taking.

Growing up, she would listen to her siblings’ tales of shenanigans and escapades. Although she did not share her older siblings daring quest for adventure, she did discover that through imagination she could find all the excitement she craved from the safety of her room. She discovered a love of reading at a young age and firmly believed that a good book should strive to make the reader feel uplifted. She was later shocked to find that nearly every English teacher she would study under disagreed with this philosophy. After countless hours reading assigned novels that included tragedies, melodramas, and modernism, Cinnamon was eventually convinced to admit that a good book does not require a happy ending. She does, however, strongly advocate for one.In college, Cinnamon met her Prince Charming and then promptly left him to pursue an opportunity to study abroad in the beautiful English countryside. Fortunately, her Prince was a patient man who waited for her return, and he has since spent nearly 25 years teaching her the meaning of love, showing her the World, helping her to raise two wonderful children, and encouraging her to pursue her dreams. Cinnamon enjoyed a long career in public sector finance, but she was delighted to leave the corporate world behind in 2014 to focus her efforts on being a homemaker. This shift gave her more time to explore new interests and hobbies which include traveling, cake decorating, crafting, and home renovations. Much to her surprise, she discovered, almost by chance, that she also loved to write. Hoping to encourage her own children to embrace reading, Cinnamon started writing stories that she thought would cater to their preferences. She focused on plots that centered around characters her children admired. Although she was informed by her children that her stories were, “good but contained too many words,” Cinnamon found an audience for her work after posting the stories on the internet. Soon, Cinnamon decided to shift her focus to writing stories based on some of her own favorite characters. For now, these include Jane Austin’s most beloved characters."," Ms Worth’s reimaginings stray far from canon, but are very creative and interesting to read, however, I started with Assumptions and Absurdities and did not like it very well. It’s a good thing I had purchased the series, as I probably would never have read another of her books. I liked this one much better. There was much more face time between ODC and Darcy did not pout or jump to unreasonable conclusions nearly as much. Also, in this story, we are shown much more of his tender, caring side and he becomes a much more sympathetic character. I also enjoyed the elements of mystery included in the story. As much of the time is spent at Pemberly, there is a more relaxed atmosphere and the usual villains/troublesome characters are far away. This was an enjoyable stroll with our favorite characters to their HEA. "," The premise is clever and the book is well written with few typos, but the characters were not acting like in the original P&P a lot. Darcy especially jumps from stoic and silent to sometimes teasing to nearly weeping with emotion. He's very inconsistent. Other characters also have changeable behavior. It took away my enjoyment of the book because a lot of the sudden changes were jarring. "," I enjoyed this read. There was just enough angst to maintain conflict. Wickham's changes were interesting, but sine of his thoughts didn't match his later actions. I enjoyed Georgie and her growth. Had the pace of the ending not have been drawn out and included more of a progression in time, a full explanation of the library conflict, or even an epilogue, I might have rated this a five. "," I was very absorbed in this book. It has an excellent balance of angst, humor and romance which held my attention and was paced spectacularly. There were various subplots, but they were interwoven carefully and all concluded by the end. It was complicated in execution, yet still rather simple in essentials. In short, this writer is gifted.It's a rather familiar premise in JAFF; Mr Bennet has died and Elizabeth has gone out into the world looking for a position. She happens across Georgiana Darcy in Ramsgate, foils the ill considered elopement with Wickham and then is approached by Colonel Fitzwilliam to become his cousin's companion. From this point on, however, our expectations are subverted because she suggests Jane for the position instead, siting her commitment to the elderly lady she's already companion for, which is so like our loyal Elizabeth. It's a much more circuitous route to Pemberley from there. Darcy, meanwhile, is considering his options for a bride and believes he's found one...I thought that the courtship between Darcy and Elizabeth was sweet and shy, though not without its bumpy roads. In reference to the latter, I appreciated how Darcy and Elizabeth were BOTH at fault in their conflicts -- particularly the initial one -- because it hearkens back to the same theme in the Austen original. In P&P, Darcy was guilty of being a prideful snot and Elizabeth for extrapolating one unfortunate comment into an indictment of his entire character (hence the pride and the prejudice, though each were arguably both). Neither was perfect, despite being perfectly matched, and that's why their characters endure over two hundred years later. I can see elements of this theme in this book.It was also surprisingly funny at points. One of my favorite parts aside from ODC's shy courtship was a conversation in which one character quotes Hamlet and states, without a trace of irony, that Shakespeare could have learned a thing or two from him. She was not joking. There were several other things that were equally humorous, but that one stood out to me.There are many other things I could recommend about this book, but I think I'll close here. Read via Kindle Unlimited and will purchase my own copy at some point. "," In this P&P variation ODC don't meet right away, only after Elizabeth meets Georgiana in Ramsgate, saves her from Wickham through some timely intervention, gets offered and declines a position as Georgiana 's companion (offered by Col. Fitzwilliam), works as a companion to an elderly lady until the lady dies, then finally accepts the position of companion to Georgiana. After all that Elizabeth finally meets Darcy at Pemberly, but even that is only after she's been there for a few months.  They get off to a rocky start due to some unbelievably poor decisions on Elizabeth 's part, namely her decision to rearrange the books in his library without permission, and then to show an appalling lack of remorse when confronted about it.I read the afterword written by the author in which she admits  Elizabeth is perhaps a little too forward here for our comfort with her character, but Ms. Worth doesn't apologize for it since it's a plot point to be discovered later. Still, I can't say that I admired Elizabeth much at that point in the story, but rather felt Darcy should have fired her on the spot. Of course that's not possible, so thankfully we get past it and move on to the evolution of the feelings they have for each other.  That development is quite slow but romantic. Darcy is less stiff and forbidding at Pemberly, and Elizabeth's opinion hasn,'t been poisoned by Wickham in this version, so she's more receptive to his charms.The events surrounding Mr. Bennett 's death and disappearance are kind of strange and far fetched.

I only wish it had been extended. I would love to see how things progressed. "," Angst, romance, angst, romance, some women's rights philosophy, angst and romantic HEA. Good writing about some bad villains. Love conquers all. "," Darcy sees Elizabeth 3 years after his rejected proposal in a home where she is employed as a governess, and he is a person of interest for their unmarried daughter.  Darcy still loves Elizabeth and wants to renew the relationship in spite of her circumstances, and he unwittingly causes her to lose her job and belongings.  They both hunger for each other after 3years of loneliness and lack of intellectual conversation.It's romantic how determined Darcy is to pursue Elizabeth, and how, for once, she allows it without the usual arguments about her unworthiness.  They are both ready to admit that they want each other and to take the steps to resolution.  There are a couple of minor villains, but nothing serious.I deducted one star for the mournful tone of the story, since Bingley is married to another, Jane is married but poor, Lydia is missing, and ODC  spent three years in loneliness and lost time from each other.  All these things were rather depressing for such a short story.  However, the book is well written and well edited, and a sweet tale. I recommend it highly. "," The author wrote a reasonable story but her writing style was fairly basic with the descriptive prose lacking in vibrancy & yet, perplexingly, she used the sophisticated 'free indirect speech' method throughout the narrative. The conversations between Darcy & Elizabeth were often witty & there were some lovely moments of flirtatious banter that was very entertaining.  However, at times when they were conscious of society's eyes upon them & the Ton's view of their respective positions in life, they behaved more circumspectly, the teasing words ceased & they talked mainly of  inconsequential matters, yet the occasional argument or serious discussion did occur. In a matter of days they were married & off to enjoy a lifetime together.One of the negative aspects of the book was when the author 'broke the fourth wall' so to speak & drew  the attention of the ""Dear Reader"" to a particular situation in the story; whenever this happened it broke my concentration (similar to having someone come over & interrupt what should be a solitary activity) . The excerpts from an 1848 letter by Charlotte Brontë to G.H. Lewes concerning the literary talents of Jane Austen were another strange aspects of this book, supposedly undertaken out of deference to both ladies - ""...  in homage to the literary disagreement between Charlotte Brontë and Jane Austen.""Unfortunately,  numerous editing issues also hindered the enjoyment of this book: typographical mistakes, wrongly spelt words, incorrect phrasings, punctuation problems & some oddly constructed sentences. The poor pagination further decreased the quality of the work: double-spaced between each line,  extra line-spacing between paragraphs, that sometimes consisted of a single sentence, for unnecessary & ineffective dramatic affect. Additionally, the use of 'flourished'  section-breaks (three horizontal lemniscates  or infinity symbols) to add more length to the book thus increasing its page count (97) - in reality, it was just puffing.Not a bad book just not a great one. It is a short read  - a reasonable option when you want to relax for a while with book & a cup of tea or coffee. "," Seriously,  this is a breath of fresh air. No copy pasting from the original novel, the story is written in the exact number of words it requires. Elizabeth is a delight,  Darcy is as well. The longing and desire is palpable through the text. Of course, there's the overt usage of ""dear reader "", but pp variations often carry much worse flaws. All in all, the story deserves to be rated higher:) "," I usually avoid Elizabeth as a governess stories, but his was pretty good. I'm glad I gave it a chance. "

It’s inevitable in a mix of stories like this, that settings and characters will be changed, sometimes quite drastically. Most of the changes are handled well, altho at times additional details or expanded scenes would have improved a story.On the downside, there are two major flaws. One is the numerous errata, some of which are so bad it made me LOL in inappropriate spots. The other is that in too many of Ms. Dixon’s stories, multiple pages are taken up in word-for-word passages from the original P&P. At least the spelling and grammar in those insertions are mistake-free, courtesy of Ms. Austen’s carefulness. Setting aside those flaws, this is a good value for P&P fans, and recommended. Following is a summary of all 10 stories:Story 1: Love Will Grow. This story keeps all the critical events of canon, but shifts the settings as well as giving Anne de Bourgh a larger role in the events at Rosings. Anne's change of heart is rather glibly explained, which is a weak point. Annoying are the many errata: ""conscious"" instead of ""conscience"", for example.Story 2: He Taught Me to Hope. Many changes to canon, but a well-developed plot with a number of surprise twists. Elizabeth Carlton nee Bennet is widowed with a son. There is a romantic triangle she must act on. Jane and Elizabeth are not close, and Jane's HEA is quite different than canon. It leaves a dangling plot thread, however. The errata continue, and some rather awful modernisms creep into the dialogue, which detract from what is otherwise a very good story. Elizabeth's son Ben is wonderful, as is Darcy’s close relationship with him, even as ODC have romantic issues.Story 3: Hope and Sensibility. Continues Story 2, and adds Wickham. I enjoyed this two-part tale the most. Darcy once again multiplies his problems by issuing autocratic ""trust me, I'm warning you for your own protection!"" commands without helpful explanations. Lydia eagerly falls in with Wickham’s nasty scheme, which goes well until a critical error. The end result follows canon, except for Bingley making a life-changing decision. Ben makes Darcy extremely proud.Story 4: A Lasting Love Affair. Elizabeth is sent off to her father's wealthy widowed aunt, Lady Vanessa Barrett. With no children, she will make Elizabeth her heir if her aunt finds her satisfactory. Elizabeth becomes the object of two men's attention. Both are handsome, wealthy and eligible; but only one makes her heart flutter. Elizabeth's liveliness is shadowed by a tragic loss in the past. Darcy finds himself in not-so-friendly competition with his friend for her hand. This story had an uneven pace, dragging a bit in the first half.One of the errata is so bad it was humorous – Caroline has not ""sidled up beside him [Darcy]"", she has ""saddled up beside him"" – in a drawing room!Story 5: Miss Elizabeth Bennet. A fire destroys Longbourn. The tragedy forces Mr. Bennet to agree to Mr. Collins' demand for Miss Elizabeth as his betrothed. Angry at her father's betrayal, Elizabeth flees her home. She ends up penniless and stranded, when Mr. Darcy comes to her rescue. Georgiana meets and becomes friends with Elizabeth. The HEA for ODC follows, but Bingley's reaction is one of mixed emotions.Story 6: A Favorite Daughter. Mr. Bennet has passed, and a search for Longbourn’s heir begins. With Jane disabled, Elizabeth has responsibility for both the estate and the Bennet family. She schemes to push Mr. Collins towards her sister Mary, using an unsuspecting ally. The Bingleys arrive at Netherfield without Darcy. Lady Catherine eventually issues an ultimatum to Mr. Collins, only to receive an unexpected response. When Elizabeth does return to Longbourn, she is horrified to discover her youngest sister Lydia has behaved foolishly, threatening their family with scandal. Will she be able to foil what is a far more serious plot against her family than she realizes?Story 7: As Good As A Lord. What might happen if Mrs. Bennet overheard Elizabeth's confession to Jane that Mr. Darcy had proposed to her while at Hunsford, but been angrily refused? Mrs. B might take a hand in bringing these two people together – to the point of joining the trip into Derbyshire. There is a minor plot hole, and again a major errata – “... I am contended wherever I must be ...”, instead of “contented”. This story is padded with extensive lifting from the original P&P.Story 8: A Tender Moment and Story 9: Irrevocably Gone. Story 8 was the least satisfying – it is not a story but the beginning chapter of a JAFF. Originally a short story that is now out of print, it would have been better to just combine it with the story “Irrevocably Gone” and note this in a preface. Story 9 mostly follows canon, but this time Jane meets Bingley face-to-face in London and their romance is rekindled. There is a pact between villains, but the subplot is not well-handled and I found it disappointing.Story 10: Something To Think Of. Elizabeth leaves Hunsford and finds Jane in surprisingly good spirits. Elizabeth has read Darcy’s letter, but doesn’t realize it has been stolen from her. When she and Darcy meet again, they begin a tentative romance. But that promising beginning is shattered when Georgiana’s scandal is discovered, and Darcy faces tremendous pressure to keep it from being made public. Elizabeth is also facing a family scandal – Lydia has disappeared, and must be found before the Bennets face social ostracism. Where’s Darcy’s letter? Will Elizabeth and Jane get their HEAs? "," This is a wonderful collection of stories where each has its own combination of twists and turns,  which had me thinking,"" I know they have to be together but how are they going to get passed this mess?"" I met a few interesting  characters and actually had to  read this  collection  twice. I'm sure you'll enjoy this wonderful collection. "," What an introduction to P.O. Dixon books. I'm now look forward to reading more books by this author.-There are ten stories in this collection. I personally love Darcy in all ten variations. Since I don't always buy into a shy Darcy, I was happy to see this more engaging Darcy.-This is minor, but just like canon, I can understand Caroline realizing it's better to befriend the new Mrs. Darcy than lose the Darcy connection- it makes sense.-For the most part, I think half the stories are 4 stars.-Two stories I give 4.5-5 stars: He Taught Me to Hope. Darcy and Ben stole the show. They were adorable.&Something to Think Of (my favorite.)  A Pride and Prejudice variation where Darcy is verbally sparring with Elizabeth's suitor. There's no denying Darcy's intentions. I'm use to Darcy wearing a mask at all times and waiting to address someone in private. Nope. Not this Darcy. I couldn't get enough of the Darcy and Hemmingsworth's discourse.The Hemmingsworth brothers was a fun addition.I like this Jane. Seeing her animated was something new.Hope and Sensibility was my only dislike with 2.5 stars. This story is a sequel to He Taught Me to Hope, but I found everyone annoying (Darcy briefly)- especially Ben and Elizabeth. Ben was spoilt and his age didn't always ring true. Elizabeth, for some strange reason, wants to elevate a servant child, Samuel, to a higher sphere so he can reach his highest potential. However, Elizabeth pushes back on her own son attending school like his father and grandfather before him. She also comes across as if she could care less if Ben receives his inheritance.Overall, this collection is a keeper. "," This is a variation of the classic with a new set of suitors for Jane and Elizabeth. After the Netherfield ball Jane goes to London with her relatives and meets twins who are wealthy, nice gentlemen. Once again the older brother falls in love with her immediately!  By now Jane has lost her grief over losing Bingley and falls for this new relationship. He purchases an estate near Longbourne and the story continues with trouble regarding Lady Catherine and the letter Darcy wrote Elizabeth ( Mr Collins stole it!).Less drama, less emotional, but still a nice story. "," Overall, I enjoyed this collection to Pride and Prejudice retellings, though there really needed to be some re-working of most of the stories. "," I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the stories in this collection.  P. O. Dixon is one of my most favorite authors. She has a wonderful imagination when it comes to what-if stories with Darcy and Elizabeth.  The good looking twin brothers should be expanded on! "," This is a lovely collection of stories by P. O. Dixon. While I read this in KU, you would get your money’s worth by purchasing!  I loved the unique twists to the situations and characters. The stories were a good length-this wasn’t a compilation of just a few short stories. Highly recommend! "," What an awesome collection of books by one of my very favorite authors. As with all of P.O. Dixon's books, each one in this collection is well written, uniquely crafted and wonderfully entertaining. One certainly cannot complain about the value for the price of this collection either! "

Unable to resist the temptation, Elizabeth indulges her wish to see a party of the beau monde and finds herself in a dangerous situation. She is saved from a desperate fate by Mr Darcy of Pemberley but relief is short-lived; Mr Gardiner arrives and demands satisfaction on behalf of his young niece’s honour.BOUND FOR THREE YEARS—with no intent to marry on either side—Mr Darcy and Elizabeth both resolve to do as they must to end their unwanted almost-betrothal. Mr Bennet however refuses to allow it, fearing that Elizabeth’s character will bear a permanent stain that no amount of time or money could erase. Together, Darcy and Lizzy contrive a plan to overcome her father’s reluctance: Darcy will find her someone else to marry, thus relieving himself of the obligation.THE FOLLY OF THEIR YOUTH, it seems, might be set to rights after all, until feelings arise which complicate the scheme. But will they realise their true attachment before it’s too late?  Read more","Amy D’Orazio is a longtime devotee of regency romance and historical fiction. She began writing her own tales to amuse herself during hours spent at her kids sports practices and the like and soon discovered a passion for it. By far, however, the thing she loves most is the connections she has made with readers and other writers in various forums! Amy currently lives in Myrtle Beach with her husband and daughters, as well as three Jack Russell terriers who often make appearances (in a human form) in her books."," At last, a JAFF story where Florizel has a larger part than George Wickham!“A Folly of Youth” begins during 16-year-old Elizabeth Bennet’s visit to her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London.  Miss Cartwright, a 19-year-old relation of her Aunt, also is enjoying spending time in London, especially Hyde Park where the following scene takes place:Another excessively high-perched curricle had come to an abrupt halt only steps away from them. A small man with flaming red hair, dressed in the ornate and excessive garb of a dandy, bounded down … with scarcely a word, the gentleman thrust a card towards Miss Cartwright, who took it without comment. With a passing glance at Elizabeth, he barked, “Bring your sister.”A more experienced girl than Elizabeth would have suspected the invitation would not be honorable.  A more prudent girl than Miss Cartwright would have known the invitation would not be respectable.Still, Miss Cartwright misleads Mr. Gardiner and he allows them to attend with only an elderly companion as chaperon.The mistakes we make in our youth, we pay for with the rest of our lives. ~ Chuck PalahniukA youthful Fitzwilliam Darcy attends the gathering without knowing the nature of the party.  He encounters Miss Bennet and takes steps to protect her from some gentlemen who are not so very gentlemanly.  His attention is seen by Mr. Gardiner who has learned the nature of the party and arrives at a crucial moment.Mr. Gardiner and Mr. Bennet insist Darcy is engaged to Elizabeth, but marriage will wait until Elizabeth reaches her majority. Elizabeth is unwilling.  Darcy is angry.Darcy attempts to buy his way out of the betrothal by adding money to a dowry for Elizabeth.  Mr. Bennet rejects all offers.Sometimes a moment of clarity shines so brightly, you have no choice but to walk into the light — or hide under the rug. ~ Cathryn LouisIn London, Darcy has been attracted by Lady Cassandra Millington.  Until he can escape from the unwanted betrothal, he is not free to make an offer to his new love.Darcy’s cousins, Colonel Fitzwilliam and Viscount Saye, invite Darcy to visit Bath, where Lady Cassandra will also be residing. Saye must find a way out of his father’s bad books.  The Earl insists Saye cease his idleness and find a respectable girl to marry.Darcy finally confesses his predicament to his cousins. Saye must have his say: “... that is the advantage of being known as a taciturn, rather pokerish fellow — your jokes are rare, and therefore sure to amuse.”The cousins make a plan: if Elizabeth Bennet agrees to marry another man, Darcy will be free to pursue Lady Cassandra.Bingley has married Jane Bennet.  They will also be in Bath with Elizabeth.The stage is set:  Darcy will introduce his single friends to Elizabeth; Saye will choose a wife; Fitzwilliam will enjoy himself as he sees fit. What could go wrong?All men make mistakes but only wise men learn from their mistakes. ~ Winston ChurchillI enjoyed this look at a stronger Bingley who gives Darcy a well-deserved set-down and a kinder Caroline who offers friendship and understanding to Elizabeth. Georgiana, who has endured a youthful folly of her own, also seeks friendship and understanding.Everyone’s favorite Viscount, Lord Saye, delivers repartee in his usual style. And don’t miss Florizel who must assist his master in presenting his best self to his chosen victim — uh, love interest.All of us who are worth anything, spend our manhood in unlearning the follies, or expiating the mistakes of our youth. ~ Percy Bysshe ShelleyI received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review. "," A creative take having ODC meet in London when Elizabeth is only 16. An impetuous decision ends in scandal for her cousin, and tragedy for Elizabeth.  Her reputation is damaged, and for the next three years she must exist on the fringes of Meryton society, her existence barely tolerated, even by her own family.Fitzwilliam Darcy feels he has paid too dearly for attempting to help a young innocent avoid the consequences of inadvertently appearing at the Cyprians Ball. The Bennets and Gardiners have checkmated him: they cannot force him to marry young Elizabeth, but they can threaten a breach of promise suit that would cause a huge scandal to the Darcy name. He cannot marry; only if Elizabeth Bennet marries another will he be free to wed a woman of his own choosing.Finally, Darcy thinks of a way out of his dilemma. All he need do is help Miss Elizabeth find a husband. She's spirited, lovely, charming, and intelligent. Any man would want to marry her, even though she has few connections and a shady reputation. As soon as she marries another, he'll be finally able to marry the lovely, wealthy, well-born Miss Cassandra.He's looking forward to it...isn't he?Viscount Saye, Darcy's cousin and elder brother to Richard Fitzwilliam, plays a good-sized role in the story, although somehow he wasn't as entertaining in this story as I usually find him. Darcy and Elizabeth don't have much face time except to insult and argue with one another. In this story, due to the loss of her reputation, Elizabeth lacks canon's wit and spirit most of the time, only finding it in a few scenes with either Darcy or Richard.In the end, because of these negatives, I couldn't give a 5-star rating. YMMV. "," This author is an automatic purchase for me. Always well constructed stories with a lot of heart, and clever and humorous banter. Any story which includes Lord Saye is fine by me. His character is always such a lovable fribble that, while you sometimes want to shake him, you end up smiling at his antics. When Elizabeth is sixteen and staying with aunt and uncle Gardiner in London, she's persuaded to attend a ball which, in her youthful ignorance, she doesn't realize is a scandalous party where the wealthy aristocrats go to find their next mistress or sexual conquest. Darcy is there against his will with Wickham, he sees Elizabeth is about to get into trouble, and he intervenes. Unfortunately, no good deed goes unpunished, and he inadvertently compromises her, which leads to years of a standoff between Darcy and Mr Bennett.The story takes place in Bath, and the gist of it is that Darcy tries to find Elizabeth a husband so that he'll be free to pursue his own high born wife. As time goes on, they each begin to admire the other, and it complicates matters. While this is happening, there's a side plot involving Lord Saye and his own quest to find a wife, which is a lot of fun. Georgiana is there and figures strongly into the plot, which is nice.I deducted a star for a couple of reasons. One is for the pall cast over the whole situation by Elizabeth's scandal and her treatment at the hands of her own family. Everyone just seems to want to be rid of responsibility for her, and it makes for a melancholy tone. The other reason is disappointment in the Gardiners. I always love aunt and uncle Gardiner, as they're much better guardians than Elizabeth's own parents. How, then, did she end up at this scandalous party, with no apparent chaperone except the sleeping companion of the other girl? The Gardiners would never have allowed this, would they? Disappointed!However, the book is well written and well edited. The romance is lovely, and the book is entertaining. I recommend it highly. "

At the gentleman's insistence, Darcy and his friend seek refuge from the rain at a nearby cottage. The young woman who greets them captivates Darcy with both her beauty and character.Elizabeth Bennet possesses a quick mind and a determined spirit. She is resolved to complete the challenge her father has set before her at Oxford Cottage. However, she does not expect to be met by a handsome stranger and fall in love, nor does she expect to find herself thrust into a situation where her quick thinking may be all that can keep both herself and her young companion safe.Oxford Cottage is Leenie Brown's debut Pride and Prejudice variation novel. If you like sweet Austen-inspired romances with surprising matchmakers, villainous foes, intelligent heroines, and thrilling adventures, then you will love this story of love that was destined to be.So, put the kettle on, grab your copy of Oxford Cottage, and join Darcy as he wanders down a forest path that ends in sweet romance._____Book Length:just over 57,750 words374 paperback pages  Read more","Leenie Brown's heroes, when growing up, were authors, and the worlds they painted with words were (and still are) her favourite playgrounds! Now, as an adult, she spends much time in the regency world, playing with the characters from her favourite Jane Austen novels and those of her own creation.When she is not traipsing down a trail in an attempt to keep up with her imagination, Leenie resides in the beautiful province of Nova Scotia with her two sons and her very own Mr. Brown (a wonderful mix of all the best of Darcy, Bingley and Edmund with a healthy dose of the teasing Mr. Tilney and just a dash of the scolding Mr. Knightley).You can find Leenie on the web at www.leeniebrown.com."," This is different from the usual stories in that Mr Bennet isn't hiding in his study but is actually a friend of Mr Darcy Sr and  Lord Matlock because they all attended University together.  Matlock meets a 5 year old Elizabeth Bennet who already knows how to play chess and is as interesting as her adult self.  She spends time with both Richard and his older brother and many of the encounters are absolutely  amazing and caused me to laugh until I cried.Mr Darcy Sr decides that Elizabeth would be perfect for his son and Matlock decides to help the relationship along once they are older.Mr Bennet has set up Oxford Cottage for the 3 older girls to learn what goes into a home including cooking, baking, growing vegetables. All the things that most have servants to do they are required to accomplish that in order to understand how hard it is for their staff and gain insight into running an estate.  Mr Bennet and his friends Mr Gardiner and Mr Phillips work with Matlock to encourage Bingley to lease Netherfield and have Darcy's assistance in order to get the couple introduced.Along the way they discovered a scheme that Wickham and Mrs Younge devised to kidnap or strongly  encourage young girls into being sold to brothels after being essentially raped by Wickham.  The secondary plot is Richard being sent to investigate this because so many girls were missing or dead.I enjoyed reading this and would recommend it.  Its missing several characters ( Collins, Charlotte, Caroline) and others are calmer ( Mrs Bennet, Kitty and Lydia) with minimal lines for Jane or Mary. It essentially revolves around Elizabeth and Darcy and the older men. "," Elizabeth and her sisters, Jane and Mary, run Oxford Cottage as a learning experience in keeping a household. Darcy and Bingley are sent their way and the men build relationships with the ladies. They are joined by Georgiana and Mrs. Younge and the storyline unfolds from there. Wickham is up to trouble but you don't actually hear much of him. No Lady Catherine or Mr. Collins. Darcy also doesn't have the same reservations about Elizabeth and Elizabeth isn't annoyed with him to start. Mrs. Bennett is much more likable, but they're is also less of her interactions. I liked the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth but you don't actually see the relationship build. Elizabeth is clearly the star and is almost Sherlock Homes clever. Mostly the characters were just very well developed and fun. You never do really get an answer to what the higher level, more important thing Colonel Fitzwilliam is involved in but that doesn't take away from the storyline.  Overall a good book and I feel like I will be reading it again. "," I bought this book a few years ago but hadn’t re-read it. After recently seeing all the positive reviews I decided I should revisit this story. I’m so glad I did!We learn in early chapters that Misters Bennet, Phillips and Gardiner are longtime close friends of the Earl of Matlock and an acquaintance of Mr Darcy Sr. Little Lizzy makes her appearance at age 5 by helping her uncle Gardiner beat Matlock at chess so we know she is very bright.The Bennet parents are very engaged with their family and each other. Kitty is ready to make her come out, while an indignant Lydia stays in the nursery. Mrs Bennet still flutters a bit, but it’s mostly an inside joke between herself and Mr Bennet. Meanwhile the eldest three Bennet daughters are receiving an unconventional education from Mr Bennet at a place he has named Oxford Cottage. Here the young ladies are learning how to run a home by doing the work themselves, without assistance from maids or footmen.Elizabeth and Jane meet Darcy (who has never been introduced to Elizabeth despite her connection to his uncle) and Bingley at Oxford Cottage, with a little connivance of Mr Bennet. They, and another gentleman, begin an admiration of the women leading to two courtships and an engagement.

"," Great story, funny in lots of places, scary in some places and soooooo romantic in just enough places. The cottage was for young Bennet daughters to learn how to live on less. A fun concept but not enough to write a novel about.But the cottage was just the tip of the iceberg. Lots of stories had the cottage in them and the biggest story had the Royal spymaster of England kidnapped by one of the students and aim a pistol at his heart.A good time was had by all. "," I enjoyed everything about this story! The characters were delightful, as well as the plot, dialogue, and exchanges between the characters! I love it when Lizzy is a bit of a savant. "," Very agreeable variation with only minor typos. Well thought through story with the exception of Jane and Mary as secondary characters got dropped with only a mention for them and their loves. I thought it odd that Wickham's victim was given so much time.  An employer would never kneel down and speak with a servant; Darcy's character was missing  the master of Pemberly persona he is always known to possess. "," just enough impertinence, wittiness, cleverness and humor all rolled into one terrific Lizzy..!  love the softer versions of Mr & Mrs Bennet and the steadfast Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam.. Wickham is in true form in his immoral behavior.. loved the new take in our P&P variations.. "

Author","Punk Rawk Books","Y","4.99","24,705","2023-03-31","237","3.9","139","Elizabeth Bennet has trained for years with her father to extract magic from poetry. It is painstaking and difficult work, fraught with elation and emotion. They send magic wands full of extracted power to the crown to be used in the war on the continent.When Fitzwilliam Darcy arrives—himself an accomplished magic extractor—he doesn’t like Miss Elizabeth. Too improper, not remotely feminine, nothing to match his exacting standards. And his standards must be exacting. He is a half fae prince. His father is the King of the Summer Court.But years ago, the Gates to the land of Faerie closed, and poetry is the only path to magic now. Mr. Darcy grudgingly acknowledges Elizabeth is good at extraction. He respects her for that, anyway.The pair work well together. They fill wands, but they vex each other. They claim to dislike the other, but their work brings them closer and closer.When they open the Gate to Faerie, they must work together. They are now England’s best and only hope for a magical treaty that could defeat Napoleon once and for all.Dear reader, this book is my love letter to fellow former English majors everywhere. Expect lots of very nerdy rumination over the meaning of all sorts of British poets (John Donne! William Blake! Andrew Marvell!) and a very special guest cameo from the original bad boy himself, Lord Byron. Plus magic, magic, lots of fae magic, a healthy dollop of dark academia atmosphere, Charlotte plus Colonel Fitzwilliam, and Mr. Darcy’s hands inside Elizabeth’s stays.  Read more","Fall in love with Mr. Darcy all over again.Valerie Lennox writes Jane Austen fan fiction.She loves to write about situations in which Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are trapped together, and she's a sucker for a good redemption arc. While her stories are not always squeaky clean, it's rare that she depicts our dear couple between the sheets unless it's within the bonds of matrimony. She lives outside Shepherdstown, WV with her son."," Apparently I’m even more nerdy than I thought.  In the forward MsLennox lets us know we don’t actually need to be familiar with the poems discussed to “get” the book.  So I didn’t look them up.  But then I was having such fun with Darcy and Lizzy debating the poems that I did.  (I agree with Darcy on so much... but Lizzy has some good points, too.) And now I have a new favorite poet, William Blake, who, oddly, I’d never heard of before.  Thank you Ms Lennox!If you are looking for a fae story with magical battles and high drama, there are other books that will be better for you.  This one is about figuring out what you want and accepting who you are.  You could even say the climax is more an anticlimax, except this is a relationship-driven story, not an action-driven one.  And it’s very much the promised love letter to poetry.  I don’t even care for most poetry, but I got swept away.  Despite a few minor issues I can’t elucidate without spoilers, it’s fabulous. I recommend for those who love poetry, or even if you, like me, just love the beauty of language. "," Interesting variation. I had a hard start to reading it because it seemed Elizabeth was too modern for the time period and I didn't particularly like her character. I forced myself to keep reading, I bought the book after all, it got better even though it was a different kind of variation. The magic coming from poetry was, I admit,  a stretch for me, so the storyline left me wanting something more. The end seemed rushed, jumping through time instead a more satisfying conclusion where the hero and heroin accomplish something other than their HEA since that was the main point of the story that had them working together before he rushed off to save his sister who couldn't actually be saved. Tricky. "," I read this in one day which is rare for me but I just got totally sucked in. No editing or trials. Just pure fun. From a dedicated P & P fan fiction enthusiast, Thank You! "," So very strange and not in a good way…I did not really enjoy this story. The premise was interesting but it was poorly executed. I did not like a Darcy that was so rude and condescending without apology, it goes against the spirit of P&P. I kept reading until the end hoping somehow the story would be saved, that never happened. I would say don’t bother but it was free so whatever…. "," This author has a great imagination and comes up with some of the most intriguing stories. This involved an un-magical Darcy who was a half-blood fae. It was fun to see the way magic worked in this alternate universe; how they could extract magic from poems and put the magic into wands to help the army against Napoleon was clever. I loved the debates about poetry and how the most magic came from poetry that had many layers of meanings.Poor Darcy really had a difficult time - his father was the King of the Summer Court in Faerie, but his mother was human. He has no faerie magic, but he has pointed faerie ears. He suffered a lot when growing up, primarily because humans in general did not trust people with Fae blood. And rightly so, for people with faerie magic; but Darcy did not have Faerie magic, but still had issues with people not trusting him, so in spite of his great wealth, he struggled with society. He is very awkward, but it is rather endearing in places.Elizabeth has never felt she belonged anywhere. Mr. Bennet is even more antisocial than we are used to seeing, but he is also committed to aiding the war effort and spends most of his time doing his important work. She loved to be useful with her father in extracting magic to charge the magic wands for the Crown. Charlotte also helps sometimes with the magical extraction, and she has in interesting part in the story.I loved the adventure in the story and the writing is very clever. I won't say more to not add spoilers, other than to say that Darcy & Elizabeth get their HEA, although it wasn't as romantic as it could have been. I couldn't quite bring myself to give it 5 stars, but I would give it 4.5 stars.I do recommend this book for those who are not too severely attached to canon P&P, as this is clearly a completely alternate universe. I received a free copy of this book from the author, and this is my honest review. "," that is the question.  Fae Prince Darcy (yes, with the pointed fae ears, et al) lives his London life in service to the Crown.  that is, creating the magical wands derived from poetry which were used to aid in England's fight against Napoleon.  while in the town of Meryton Thomas Bennet and his daughter Elizabeth were of the same occupation.  and, yes, Darcy (and Bingley) would join forces with the Bennet father and daughters.  (mostly in sarcasm and ire from Elizabeth's point of view).  a complicated tale - a FAErytale - for sure.  but once entrapped in this tale, Darcy and Elizabeth would find magical moments for a lifetime.

They meet Mr Thomas Bennet, an art history professor at one of the universities there, and his two daughters, Jane and Elizabeth. The Bennets are part of a group trying to restore the stolen works of art taken by Napoleon's army when they plundered Belgium.

Melanie was invited to post on DarcyandLizzy.com, and is now an author there. She can be found on Goodreads as an author. Her blog is http://www.melschertz.com"," Character names taken from P&P, but everything changed.  There's no insult standing between Elizabeth and Darcy, there's no entail resulting in a dysfunctional Bennett family, Mr Bennett has a son and only the two oldest (and best) daughters, Mrs Bennett is deceased and was beloved, no Wickham or Mr Collins, and the daughters have substantial dowries.  The tale is based on the terrible theft of priceless art by Napoleon and his armies from many places, including Bruges in Belgium.  Mr Bennett is a respected art historian who, together with Jane and Elizabeth, lives in Bruges and is involved in recovering stolen art.  Darcy and Georgiana travel to Bruges so that Georgiana can study under some famous art masters.  They rent a home belonging to the Bennetts, meet the family, and become close.This is one of those tales wherein Elizabeth, Jane, and Mr Bennett are wonderfully wonderful.  Mr Bennett isn't weird, but rather is warm, friendly, helpful, and intelligent.  Jane is, of course, beautiful, but is also highly intelligent, and knows how to run a home and keep accounts.  Elizabeth is brilliant, has a photographic memory, knows everything about anything, cares for orphans, and can also run a home.The introduction of Colonel Fitzwilliam, Charles Bingley, and his sister Caroline is explained, but not very well.  They all show up in Bruges, and it's a little too contrived.  The colonel was invited, the Bingleys just tag along, but there's no good reason for their presence except to accommodate the plot and provide for drama.  It doesn't make much sense.  The drama, becomes quite extreme at times, with people getting killed and wounded, and crazy people running around.  In fact, it's a little disturbing how people in this era felt that they could declare a family member insane when they became a problem or an inconvenience.  Just a thought.The book is written in a very simple style, and there are a LOT of mistakes.  Grammar and usage is a problem, lots of words misspelled or missing altogether.  I always expect to find an error here and there, but this work could use a serious editing.  The romance occurs with no difficulties, as if the two gentlemen heroes came to Bruges with no other agenda than to fall in love without delay.  There's a very strange practice going on in the Bennett and Fitzwilliam families of keeping dowries and inheritances a secret.  It just made me scratch my head and wonder why, when being forthright would have saved a lot of heartache.This is not great literature, but it's an enjoyable story, and I recommend it for a light hearted tale. "," Creative placement of Mr Bennett and his family (just Jane and Lizzy) in Brugge in Napoleonic War time with a counter plot of recovering stolen art.  The characters were some of our favorites - Colonel Fitzwilliam, Georgiana, Charles Bingley and his totally off the rails crazy Caroline Bingley and some new supportive characters - good and bad.  There are reports of war crimes that are harsh and perhaps it is only in the Kindle version, but I saw lots of typos - sentences unfinished a few times in  the first few pages, ""hoist"" instead of ""foist"" and other one letter off errors... but the story was good enough to ignore it.  I don't remember that being the case from what I've read from this author before - so it may have been a timely Covid related technical error.  I forgive easily when there is a great story, especially a new twist.  A nice history was created for this family.  Nice to see the Bennet's functional and flourishing.  I wonder if more could be made in comparing the present love birds with the past couple who lived in the two houses? "," I enjoyed reading this story because I am a fan of "" The Not So Poor Bennet Family "" stories!  Darcy and his sister go to Burges for her to study with the Fine Art Masters and one of the professors is Mr Bennet who lives with his 2 daughters ( Jane and Elizabeth) while his son runs Longbourne.  Mr Bennet is involved in the recovery of the art stolen by the French military.  Too throw a wrench into their land lives - Colonel Fitzwilliam, Charles Bingley, and that red headed witch Caroline Bingley arrive! "," Interesting mystery themed variation of how Darcy and Elizabeth meet and fell in love. Loved how accurate in detail the author made some scenes. Truly loved how Richard and Jane fell in love. Bingley in most of story did not have a backbone, but he did finally grow one. No Wickham in this story, but Caroline is a lunatic. The story is interesting, funny in some places, sad, and depicts real life situations. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good storyline. "," What fun to be had. Stolen artifacts, evil sisters, and romance abound in a setting unlike most Pride and Prejudice fan fiction. It is a story that captured my imagination from the premise to the final escapade within, it had a swoon-worthy Colonel, an over-protective Darcy, and a perfectly sweet jane that was allowed a moment of humanity. Wonderful fun was had from the first swipe! "," The story was interesting and quite different from the traditional cannon.  It was also told rather simplistically.  However, as in many of the JAFF books, an editor is sorely needed.  There were grammatical mistakes aplenty and wrong words used.  For example, intending to say ""rogue"" the word ""rouge"" was used.  A mistake that may have passed spell-check but, hopefully, not a live editor. "," This is a very pleasant read - perfect for when you wish to avoid relationship angst and still enjoy an interesting storyline. "," The writing was adequate but not exceptional. I thought the relationships developed too rapidly and lacked depth. Additionally, the Bingley siblings storyline, was a bit overdramatized, while (Spoiler Alert) Bingley’s death was glossed over without any emotion. The premise of the art thefts had promise, but again, needed more development. I believe this author has promise though. "

Her playful banter and refreshing demeanor are a relief in the sweltering heat, but she's a danger to Darcy's heart.Will Darcy's defenses melt away until he takes the most daring risk of all?Dangerous When Wet is a light-hearted, sweet Regency romantic comedy inspired by Jane Austen's timeless classic, Pride and Prejudice. It's novella-length and appropriate for all ages.  Read more","Jennifer Joy believes in happy endings, sweet romance, and plenty of intrigue. She writes what she most enjoys reading, so expect lighthearted, page-turning stories with suspense and a few laughs.Born on the beautiful Oregon coast, she now calls the Andes Mountains home with her husband and twins. "," Fitzwilliam Darcy is at his London home when he receives a desperate request from his friend Charles Bingley who has already arrived at Netherfield Park.  “I am an absolute dolt! It is our first day at Netherfield Park, and already I have failed.”Bingley’s failure, you ask. The ice house is empty, and Hertfordshire suffers from unrelenting heat — that’s right, unrelenting heat in October!Bingley’s need:  ICE!  ICE!  ICE!The temperature's rising,It isn't surprising,She certainly can can-can.Songwriter: Irving BerlinNone of the Bennet sisters, including the athletic Elizabeth, will do the can-can in the course of this novella.  However, the athletic Elizabeth does expose some — but not all — of the skin visible during that dance, certainly more skin than is the norm in Regency England.  Even the equally athletic Fitzwilliam Darcy will have some exposure.It turns out a river crossing both Netherfield Park and Longbourn has two deep and inviting swimming holes. One is noted as Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, near Bingley’s leased estate.Quote from the book:  A copse of trees bunched along a stream provided a more favorable target for our evaporating energies. Directing my horse to the shade of a sprawling oak with roots plunging into the water, I dismounted and let the gelding drink. Dipping my handkerchief into the water, I splashed my face and gloried in the cool liquid trickling down my neck and soaking into my wretched neck cloth. It was a lovely spot, complete with a rope dangling from a thick branch over the deepest part of the stream. Fifteen years ago, I would have been tempted to swing from it. The memory stirred in my breast.Gee, her anatomyMakes the mercuryJump to ninety-three.Songwriter: Irving BerlinI must not forget about Jemima, the resident duchess — uh, duck-ess — who lives at the swimming hole.  Jemima is a friendly duck but she does have preferences. Poor Caroline Bingley.

None were needed.I loved this short book and chortled all the way!The way that she movesThat thermometer provesThat she certainly can can-can.Songwriter: Irving BerlinThe author gave me a free copy of this book.  I am voluntarily leaving a review. "," A delightful romp which imagines a different meeting of the Bennet daughters with Bingley and Darcy. Darcy is almost immediately impressed by Miss Elizabeth, and in turn Elizabeth sees a more approachable Mr. Darcy. This helps them begin a promising friendship, even as Darcy still tries to hold himself back from making an unsuitable marriage.Bingley shows an unexpected forcefulness. Darcy is humbled when he makes several embarrassing decisions.  Caroline finds her ambition might exceed her reach.And most importantly, Jemima is a very wise duck.Recommended for all P&P fans who like their Darcy with a self-effacing sense of humor. "," A sweet and fun short story, so much fun that I wish it were longer. Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam visit Bingley at Netherfield during an unusually hot streak of weather in October, so hot that the best way to endure it is to swim in the local stream. The three men's first excursion to the stream has them interrupting the five Bennett daughters and Mr Bennett, and Darcy is immediately captivated by Elizabeth and her graceful abilities on a rope swing and in the water. He encounters her there several more times, and his attraction increases. Of course, Caroline Bingley disapproves of swimming, and she's made to look ridiculous and churlish by her haughtiness.This story is completely lacking in all of the acrimony that usually accompanies the development of a relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. Darcy is much quicker to capitulate, and Elizabeth is disposed to like him almost from the start. The role played by Jemima the duck is cute and funny, and even Darcy's valet Weller gets into the act.The book is well written and well edited.  I recommend it highly for a light, amusing way to pass a few hours. "," I like the way the story is told. It is light-hearted throughout. We get insights to Darcy's thought processes that explain his unusual behavior.

Relaxed days of swimming enable Lizzie and Darcy to come together in an angst free environment.Lots of original banter occurs between the two groups.

Read more","Discover more of the author’s books, see similar authors, read author blogs and more"," This book seems like a lark on the part of the author, sort of like an exercise is seeing what she can get away with in terms of premise and characters.  The book summary let's you know right away that the premise is ludicrous.  Darcy is accosted at the Meryton assembly by an adolescent girl named Prudence who kicks him in the shin after overhearing his infamous insult about Elizabeth.  We never learn exactly how old Prudence is, but apparently she must be old enough to speak freely and articulately to an adult man.  She lays into Darcy about being an arrogant snob, and starts demanding that he clean up his act and start being a nice person, advice that he immediately takes to heart.  Yeah, I'm sure that this is likely (wink, wink)!!Alright, in the spirit of a light and fluffy story, this girl is supposed to be cute and amusing, but she's so precocious that it becomes a bit scary.  And to make it even harder to swallow, I don't like Elizabeth at all in this version.  She's a major witch (with a capital B) to Darcy, so much so that I didn't even want him to fall in love with her.  Talk about a shrew!!Under the influence of Prudence, Darcy becomes this silly man who is not recognizable.  On a very short acquaintance, he agrees to some pretty heavy and highly personal requests made by Prudence's mother.  He becomes endearingly sappy around children.  He confides his most horrifying secrets to Prudence, even though she, as a young female, shouldn't be hearing about such sensitive subjects.  In other words, it's ludicrous.This author is a good enough writer, but this book reads like the work of a beginner.  There are several editing errors, but not enough to become a distraction.  If you don't mind a very silly story, then this is for you.  As for myself, I can't really recommend it. "," An adorable non-canon child and a few other non-canon characters spice up this alternate universe. A very cranky and obstinate Elizabeth quarrels constantly with an arrogant and disdainful Darcy until they begin to understand each other, assisted by young Prudence. A few more misunderstandings, a little villainy, lots of lessons learned, and some sweet romance. "," Nice low angst story.  However it read like a young adult (or younger) book.  Glad it was available on KU. "," This is a charming novel!  Prudence is a delightful character, and her honest take on the behavior of our various characters is refreshing.  It was a lot of fun to see Prudence steer Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth towards the best versions of themselves, although they humorously manage to keep getting off track even with her expert guidance.This was a comedic romp through Hertfordshire, and I enjoyed it immensely.  I've loved everything I read by this author, and I hope there will be more! "," Wynne Mabry has quite an imagination. This is the third of her books that I've read in the last three days, and I'm enjoying them. This one strains credulity a bit but it's entertaining. Darcy is called to account by a clear-eyed ten-year-old girl. Maybe what we all love about Darcy is that he really wants to be a good person and he's willing to hold himself up to scrutiny, unlike many gentlemen of the period (or so I imagine). Here, the push toward self-examination comes from a surprising quarter, so Darcy's willingness is even more laudable.Not deep, but enjoyable. "," This is the second book i have read that has precocious children in it. Prudence is wise beyond her years and has taken on Darcy. She's instrumental in helping him change his outlook and become much more pleasant to others.  She's absolutely fantastic!The main characters are still with us - Wickham is as dastardly as usual. Caroline still has her nose in the air. Mrs Bennett still obsessed with getting her daughters married. Lady Catherine is still herself.  The biggest difference is Elizabeth. For several chapters she is angry and unwilling to even think that Darcy has any redeeming qualities. I wanted to slap her! "," This is a unique story line wherein the action is driven by an outspoken young girl of unspecified age. She is Lizzy's volunteer advocate who puts Darcy in his place after his infamous comment at the Meryton Assembly; and the story takes off from there. The three usual antagonists each make a brief appearance creating little angst in the story. "," Sorry, but I enjoyed this book! Is it really a stretch to think Darcy would talk to an impertinent little girl? This is the man who raised his sister and marries one of the most impertinent young ladies in literary history.  Only negative is that it could have been longer with Charlotte's and Colonel's stories fleshed out more. Pick it up and have a fun read! "

Enjoy!🌹 "," This story had a creative and unique plot that I had not encountered previously, despite reading several hundred PPFF books. Lady Catherine and Wickham are still awful villains, but the other usual troublemakers seem easily dealt with. Even with all the action in the plot, however, the emotional level of the participants is very low key. Even in the wrap-up at the end, where everything and everyone is getting sorted, the emotion and loving words are minimal, and seem secondary to tying everything up… making a very unsatisfying HEA. I also didn’t like how Lady Catherine’s part was resolved by her family hushing things up, and moving her to a remote location, rather than her being accountable to the law, although, I’m sure part of that was the way the law of that time was bent in favor of the peerage.

A family connection is discovered between the first Mrs Bennett and Lady Catherine, resulting in an upheaval for Lady Catherine and her daughter.I was happy with the original premise for this story. It's far fetched, but I was ready to accept it. Unfortunately, other factors arose, and made me less inclined to go along with the idea. The book is written well enough. However, it appears the author is so set upon using flowery and formal language that she often gets tripped up by it. There was too-many-to-count instances of sentences that made no sense, or of poor grammar and usage of inappropriate words. I'm all for JAFF variations that honor Regency era notions or ways of speaking. However, this one went way over the top, to the point of seeming somewhat ridiculous.Then there was the lack of romance. Elizabeth and Darcy have encounters throughout the story, but an attraction between them is hardly mentioned. Then at the end they're getting engaged, as they should, but we're cheated out of any sort of buildup to their resolution. I think Mary and Mr Collins have a lot more screen time for their relationship. Also, the author's treatment of Mr Bennett's relationship with his second wife is kind of strange. Mr Bennett seems like a pretty useless blob of a man, who remarried strictly for a caretaker for his daughters and his house. Not a very admirable person. I tentatively recommend the book, but this is definitely not great literature. "," I wanted to like or love this book after paying such a price for it. Unfortunately, it was okay at best.I liked the beginning and the way Darcy and Elizabeth got on together. There isn't much romance after that. Mystery, crime, and threats follow. Not so much to be considered an angsty story, but there is violence. Relationships seemed rushed.-Caroline and Elizabeth's friendship-Caroline and the viscount-Charlotte and the Colonel (For some reason, writers feel the need to pair Charlotte with someone, and for some reason, they think the Colonel is the perfect candidate. I don't get it)At times the story came across like a bunch of little scenes here and there. In other instances, I felt like something was missing or glossed over. I needed more depth to these characters.Sidenote: Caroline must be delusional if she genuinely believes that she and Lady Catherine are equal because her sister, Louisa, married a gentleman. "

Seeing the pretty lady before him, a lady of no consequence or fortune, he believes he should not form an attachment to her, unsuitable as such a woman is to be his wife. What he cannot see, however, is the truth, that the simple country girl harbours a secret. Before she meets Darcy, Elizabeth has spent two years hiding from the men who killed her beloved first husband. Feeling herself destroyed by love, Elizabeth is certain she will never love again, certainly not the arrogant man who has offended her from the first moment of their acquaintance. In time, Elizabeth surprises herself by finding in Darcy a friend; even greater is her surprise to find herself gradually coming to love him and even accepting an offer of marriage from him. As the newly married couple is beginning to settle into their happily-ever-after, a condemned man on his way to the gallows divulges a shattering truth, a secret that contradicts everything Elizabeth thought she knew about the tragic circumstances of her first marriage. Against the advice of everyone who loves her—including Darcy—Elizabeth begins to seek the truth, knowing she must have it even if it may destroy her newfound happiness with Darcy.Of note, this ebook is a re-issue of a book of the same title but different cover.  Read more","Amy D’Orazio is a longtime devotee of regency romance and historical fiction. She began writing her own tales to amuse herself during hours spent at her kids sports practices and the like and soon discovered a passion for it. By far, however, the thing she loves most is the connections she has made with readers and other writers in various forums! Amy currently lives in Myrtle Beach with her husband and daughters, as well as three Jack Russell terriers who often make appearances (in a human form) in her books."," This is one of Amy D'Orazio's best! Such an interesting premise, not your usual P and P variation. All our favorite characters are here with their own recognizable personalities, but in an entirely new situation that includes murder, mystery, government intrigue and love! What more could you ask for!? Read the book description, buy it, and then be ready for a great read! This was one I couldn't put down! "," Stories where Elizabeth's dowry and/or status is higher than Darcy's have seldom worked for me, so I was reluctant at first. But I've been on a reading binge, so here I am, reviewing it after an enjoyable read.Many reviews have detailed the plot, so no need to go over it yet again. Elizabeth is hiding several secrets, and suffice to say Fitzwilliam Darcy puts not just one, but both feet in his mouth, and almost swallows them as well. The Matlocks were hoping to match the two of them, and can only roll their collective eyes at his fumbling attempts at romance.The strongest scenes are the ones with Henry, Elizabeth's son. He's a delightful child, and the interactions between him and Darcy are very well written. We also see much of what's in Darcy's mind as his romantic fortunes rise and fall several times. This is a change from canon, and it adds extra dimension to make Darcy a more sympathetic character.Although the story is a little weak on the often-used plot twist of how Elizabeth and Darcy will get their HEA, the careful step-by-step process of discovery is logically laid out. I never like it when an author takes the shortcut of having the hero/heroine make a sudden brilliant deduction 'out of the blue'. Instead, we see the gradual accumulation of inconsistencies, that give rise to unpleasant suspicions which can't be easily explained away.The author gives Elizabeth an excellent reason for finally losing her temper and verbally pushing the villain to confess. Again, it's very logical and fits her character.So despite a couple of weak points in the plot, I gave this a full 5-stars for very good execution of a complex cast of characters. Our favorite hero and heroine remain recognizable, despite meeting under a different set of circumstances. There is considerable angst, but it never descends into overwrought melodrama.If you're looking for an easy quick read, or some light beachside romance time – don't start this!  It is an intense and emotional P&P drama, not a lightweight read. Keep that in mind, and you may find a lot to enjoy in this story. "," I enjoyed reading this version of P&P where Elizabeth is widowed and married Darcy . There are lots of emotional scenes and hat almost made me cry but I still enjoyed the experience. Although, some parts of the story has loop holes that could have been fixed with good editing. Besides that overall a good variation. "," I saw so much promotion for this story on social media that I was initially wary of it. I've been ""duped"" before. But I was very intrigued by the storyline and couldn't stay away. I won't go through the synopsis because if you read it, they do a good job of summarizing the story for you.First thing: Interesting reversal of roles with Elizabeth being of a higher social standing and having more of a fortune than Darcy right out of the gate. That being said I really disliked Mrs. Bennet in this story because of Lizzy's new circumstances. I preferred her poor without these haughty airs. She grated on my nerves and I'm glad after a certain point we didn't read much of her anymore.One thing I liked was how famous lines from the original were spoken by different characters, most notably many of Mr. Bennet' lines spoken by his wife, such as when Bingley comes to Netherfield. I really felt bad for Bingley in this story. I'm so used to him being treated with deference that this story caught me off guard haha.I could sympathize with both Darcy and Lizzy in this story considering the circumstances they were going through (especially Lizzy) but I found it hard to LIKE them all that much in the beginning. They were both really just downright mean to each other. It was tough to read. I'm also not a fan of either character having had a previous relationship, ESPECIALLY if a child comes from that relationship. It's a personal nitpick of mine, but it made this story harder to read. Once they married, however, my love for them took off. They really were put through the wringer in this story which I'll get to.One of my favorite scenes was when Lizzy was inebriated and ""took advantage"" of Darcy. Their subsequent conversation of her having to offer HIM marriage after taking such liberties was amusing. Also, Darcy with Henry was the sweetest thing. I loved their relationship.Slight spoiler alert below...I knew deep down just what the grand mystery was when Lizzy had to go back to being Lady Courtenay but it was depressing to go through the motions of seeing Lizzy and Darcy separated. Also, I was frustrated with how stupid Lizzy was not to figure it out! I'm glad she finally did but sheesh! I probably will read this again because the scenes between Darcy and Lizzy were just too good. Lots of ""naughty times"" (the sketches were hilarious) and though there was nothing explicit in this story, definitely a book for more mature readers.I say if you have the heart for the amount of angst in this book, you won't be disappointed. True love does prevail but man there's a lot of sadness in this story! "," I read this book a while  back but when it appeared on my ""you might be interested in this"" list, I was intrigued. Some parts were familiar but much of the story pulled me into its mysterious twists and turns! So pleased that  I re-read it! Time Worthy! "

The views and opinions expressed are my own. With many parts of the US facing a Snowmageddon of unimaginable magnitude in its proportions, it was appropriate to read a story featuring our favorite P&P characters snowbound at Pemberley. [4.5 Stars rounded to 5]“A cold wind was blowing from the north, and it made the trees rustle like living things.” –George R.R. Martin, A Game of ThronesLet’s just say that the opening scene featuring the near miss just about sent me over the edge. When Fitzwilliam Darcy exited the carriage, I nearly fell over. Whew! Talk about your close call. That was an amazing scene that will give the reader nightmares after the rush of adrenalin has passed. Hopefully, my heart rate will soon resume its proper rhythm.“A lot of people like snow. I find it to be an unnecessary freezing of water.” –Carl ReinerWhat I liked: Darcy and Elizabeth, of course. The Gardiner family. And, I enjoyed Lady Catherine’s visit. She was the only one with enough moxie or brass to address the visiting Bingley harridan and put her in her place. Oh-My-Gosh! I loved that part. Her Ladyship was a scream during several encounters with the terror of the north. If there is ever to be a skirmish, I want Lady C in my corner. That was hilarious.What I didn’t like: It ended abruptly. I don’t know what happened to certain characters. There was a promise of retribution and I was waiting with bated breath and it didn’t happen. I wanted a damage report or blood drawn. This person was horrid and deserving of a comeuppance to match their behavior. Then the family secret was another puzzle piece that fit for a time and then was removed and cast aside and forgotten. It seems the dead would be allowed to take their secrets to the grave with them.“I love snow for the same reason I love Christmas: It brings people together while time stands still. Cozy couples lazily meandered the streets and children trudged sleds and chased snowballs. No one seemed to be in a rush to experience anything other than the glory of the day, with each other, whenever and however it happened.” –Rachel Cohn, Dash & Lily’s Book of Dares "," Fate intervenes in this P&P variation.  Elizabeth Bennet does not go to Hunsford to visit her friend Charlotte Collins (nee  Lucas).  Instead she and her elder sister Jane  are invited to take a trip with their Aunt and Uncle Gardiner and their children.  He has business concerns in the North that he must address in person and it happens to be in the area of Pemberley, Mr. Darcy's estate.  They enjoy visiting many of the great houses in the area.  However Elizabeth is determined not to visit Pemberley.  This is where fate intervenes and literally throws them in the path of not only Mr. Darcy but Mr. Bingley as well.  They end up invited to stay at Pemberley because of snow.  However they are not the only guests.  So what happens next is all up to ODC. "," Our story opens quietly. Jane and Elizabeth Bennet are in the Gardiners’ carriage, beginning their journey home with their aunt, uncle, and four young cousins.Then, with little warning:  “The babble of voices could barely reach her as she stared in lingering shock at the approaching carriage – the dark chestnuts, their eyes still wide with fright – the ashen-faced coachman wrapping the reins thrice around his wrist and thus freeing his hand to make the sign of the cross, then regaining purchase on the leather straps and pulling them as taut as might be, so that he could bring his team to a standstill that much quicker.”A dire situation is avoided only by the skill of the carriage driver, who realizes he owes thanks to his maker.  A passenger emerges from the coach.  The Bennet sisters are shocked — it is Mr. Darcy and the Bingley party.In the gathering snow, damage is discovered to the Gardiners’ carriage. Passengers are re-arranged within the two carriages and the group travels to Pemberley where they will remain until the storm passes and repairs can be made.When it snows, you have two choices: shovel or make snow angels. ~ Author unknownIn this instance, both choices are necessary. Temporary repairs must be made to a bridge and a road must be closed until a permanent rebuild can be done in the spring.The Gardiner children ensure that plenty of fun will be had in the snow. Everyone — with the exception of Miss Bingley and her sister — grows to love those four.Snowflakes are kisses from heaven. ~ Author unknownFitzwilliam Darcy had long admired Elizabeth Bennet.  His narrow escape from death prompts a firm decision.  He will court the girl and this time he will win.  Ditto for Charles Bingley and Jane Bennet.Caroline Bingley and Lady Catherine don’t meet face to face in canon P&P, but the grand lady arrives at Pemberley and is also snowbound.  “Glass houses” has a double meaning and zingers hit their target. Lady Catherine is able to accept the inevitable with good grace.  A relationship seems a little incomplete, but a resolution might not have been possible.Some Joana Starnes books are super angsty.  This story — not so much. A beautiful romance and a HEA for everyone except Caroline Bingley.Snowmen fall from heaven — unassembled. ~ Author unknown "

This book of 64,000 words takes Elizabeth and Darcy out of their usual circumstances and meeting places. All of the usual villains are part of the story but minimized significantly. If you enjoy a light-hearted version of Our Dear Couple’s road to Happily Ever After, this may be a book for you.Excerpt:Mr. Thomas Bennet massaged his temples as his five-day-old daughter again woke and cried in hungry complaint. He and the wet nurse Mrs. Lindsay had been on the road for two days with the infant, and his nerves had been strained to their limit by the poor babe’s pitiable circumstance – a mother who could not, would not, stand even the sight of her newborn child simply for its misfortune of failing to be born a male and the heir the mother desperately desired for the family’s entailed estate.Mrs. Bennet had always been an excitable woman, but her husband had been utterly unprepared for her refusal to feed, hold, or even look at her new daughter. The midwife had informed him that she had witnessed this phenomenon in new mothers before, but never to the degree that his wife had displayed when she had threatened to harm the child if it was not removed from her presence. After two days of trying unsuccessfully to coax Mrs. Bennet to at least view the beautiful child, the father had been forced to take action to secure the tiny girl’s life and future.It must be providential that I heard from my university friend just this week, Bennet thought.  Read more","Discover more of the author’s books, see similar authors, read author blogs and more"," Another Elizabeth Bennet isn't raised as a Bennet story with an important twist. She's adopted by an Earl and his wife because Mrs Bennet refuses to even look at her newborn daughter.  Hoping to save her life Mr Bennet asks an old school friend to adopt his 2 day old daughter. Elizabeth is raised by two wealthy parents who had suffered through several miscarriage and still borns.  Lady Elizabeth meets Miss Jane Bennet in London and they become best friends and are informed of their history by Mr Bennet.  Throughout the story its stressed that Lady Elizabeth can't go to Hertfordshire or meet Mrs Bennet because she looks like Mr Bennet's mother and his fear is Mrs Bennet will use Elizabeth to get monetary support.Jane meets Colonel Fitzwilliam before she meets Bingley and he's there to support her after Bingley walked away with his sisters approval.  Of course Lady Elizabeth meets Darcy at an assembly in Lambton and their path is without angst or "" tolerable "" statements. "," So the story starts out with Mr Bennet giving his newly born daughter away because his wife is crazy.  This is good because she will grow up and be Lady Elizabeth and have wonderful parents.My thought was why did Mr. Bennet keep having children with his insane wife and then do nothing for his other daughters.  I know I’m being critical and it not helpful to the storyline but really does he not have a backbone.Lady Elizabeth and Miss Bennet meet at Lady Matlock house and they notice they have the same necklace with different stones and it was given to them on their sixteenth birthday.  Well I must say here I thought it was a bit of reach since more than necklace was made duh, and probably some other ladies were bound to have the same necklaces.  Okay, then we go on with story.  While I enjoyed the story there were some holes for me.  Darcy was better at accepting Elizabeth’s adoption and the colonel was awesome. "," Mrs. Bennet has a severe case of postpartum depression when Lizzie is born and her father finds an excellent childless couple to adopt her.Who’s to say this might not happen? So from the beginning the what-if is easy to engage with. Pleasant story where the main thrust is of nice people telling little whit lies for all the right reason but the effects begin to be much larger than expected.Fun story. I love these little low angst stories from the author. "," I enjoyed this book because it is well written.  The character development is excellent. A new and wonderful Elizabeth shows the same great woman of old. The other sisters were not shown much as the original family is not discussed. "," My favorite variations offer very little of Mrs. Benny, Lydia, Lady Cat deB and Caroline Bingley. Taking it over the top is Jane marrying anyone but Charles Bingley. Good read with no angst; the matching necklaces wasn’t worth more than a passing acknowledgement so using it as the catalyst for the sisters connecting was a real stretch. "," The story shows how it is not who births you but who raises you. Elizabeth is adopted and loved by all. She fills the void of her parents and they live as their own. Beautiful story. "," This is a wonderful Elizabeth is and is not a Bennet story. I felt so sad for Mr Bennet, but very glad that Mrs Bennet never intruded on Elizabeth's life.

Fortunately for the Darcys they have some previously unknown, very well placed connections.This story concerns the reclamation of the Darcys good reputation and the introduction of some very important friends into their lives, including Elizabeth Bennet. "," Regency England had more than its share of seducers.  and, of course, Wickham would reek his mayhem and sow his seed without conscience.  women were harmed.  he cared not.  Georgiana Darcy was also harmed.  her family cared greatly.  so this story was about righting wrongs and indiscretions within families and without.  this story did have its drawbacks.  another failure to edit.  so much of this tale was literally copied from Pride or Dignity, another of the author's works.  good as a whole - it ends with HEA's for many.

Despite what his friends say, he is not lonely in the White House. He’s not. And he has vowed not to date while he’s in office. Nor is he interested in Elizabeth Bennet. She might be pretty and funny and smart, but her family is nouveau riche and unbearable. Unfortunately, he encounters her everywhere in Washington, D.C.—making her harder and harder to ignore. Why can’t he get her out of his mind? Elizabeth Bennet enjoys her job with the Red Cross and loves her family, despite their tendency to embarrass her. At a White House state dinner, they cause her to make an unfavorable impression on the president, who labels her unattractive and uninteresting. Those words are immediately broadcast on Twitter, so the whole world now knows the president insulted her. Elizabeth just wants to avoid the man—who, let’s admit it, is proud and difficult. For some reason he acts all friendly when they keep running into each other, but she knows he’s judging her. Eventually, circumstances force Darcy and Elizabeth to confront their true feelings for each other, with explosive results. But even if they can find common ground, Mr. Darcy is still the president—with limited privacy and unlimited responsibilities—and his enemies won’t hesitate to use his feelings for Elizabeth against him.

Today she teaches business writing to willing office professionals and tries to give voice to the demanding cast of characters in her head. She lives in Virginia with her husband, two children who love to read, a cute (but clumsy) puppy, and an overly affectionate cat. A lifelong Jane Austen fan, Victoria confesses to an extreme partiality for the Colin Firth miniseries version of Pride and Prejudice.Please visit her website at www.victoriakincaid.com."," I read probably a dozen different P&P modern variations at this point, and this one... hands down, the best!I still didn't like Elizabeth for a period of time, because she was just judgemental with little provocation but this Elizabeth is a hundred times better than most others out there.Plus, there was a connection between the leads. The real chemistry.I even liked that she was proactive in her relationship, not just wishing and waiting as all others do - that might have worked for 1800s but not for 21st century. "," I liked this, but it's kind of an odd mix between NOT-To-Be-Taken-Seriously with a little bit of To-Be-Taken-Seriously.In the first category, you can start with the Bennet family business, called On-A-Stick. Mr. Bennet seems as flaky as Mrs. Bennet, though in a different way; he's constantly in sales mode for his food empire. The name pretty much describes it, though we're not talking corn dogs here, people. Among others, Mr. Bennet's products are Ravioli-On-A-Stick, Egg-On-A-Stick (""hard-boiled, of course"") and Cookie-On-A-Stick. He's frustrated because his R&D department hasn't been able to figure out a way to develop Spaghetti-On-A-Stick. Okay. THIS is beyond belief. All the Bennets except Lizzy are employees.She works for the Red Cross, frequently traveling abroad wherever humanitarian aid is needed. Now THAT's something to take seriously, and Lizzy is very dedicated to the Red Cross's mission and the funding necessary to reach all the areas in crisis.Continuing in NTBTS (Not-To-Be-Taken-Seriously) category, the Bennet family has been invited to a State Dinner at the White House, presumably because they have been campaign contributors in the past. Lydia wanders outside the East Room, where the dinner is being held, and Lizzy follows to hunt her sister down. Security doesn't corral Lydia immediately before she gets to a restricted area. If I believed for a moment this was a true representation of the level of security in the White House, I would be seriously concerned.There are other NTBTS features as the book goes along. Most significantly, the POTUS can't arrange to meet quietly with a girl he'd like to date?? Um, doubtful. And that's one of the major obstacles for ODC here. This is the strangest Presidency ever.Speaking of obstacles, there's Lydia, who's a pain-in-the-bum brat. She needs her cell phone/ipad and whatever other electronic devices she has taken away from her after her very first tweet that embarrasses her sister and the POTUS. Yes, the Bennets are inadequate parents, but I don't buy that they wouldn't take notice of their daughter's NATIONAL notoriety. (This ain't the rural farmland around Meryton.) Perhaps they think bad publicity is better than no publicity when Lydia shares the President's insults about Lizzy with the world, but that's never mentioned. Instead, Lydia gets worse as the book goes on, especially once she hooks up with George Wickham. Okay, that part is very Pride and Prejudice so I guess it's necessary, but it still bugs me.Ms. Kincaid writing is quite good, as usual. The romance is sweet and angst-y. William Darcy may be the POTUS, but he's still a hot-blooded single guy. He develops a huge crush on Lizzy Bennet. Unfortunately, as good as he is at policy wonking, he's pitiful with non-policy social interaction. (Back to the NTBTS department, how on earth did this guy get through all the fundraisers and glad-handing that's necessary to be elected President, anyway?) He has no idea how to approach Lizzy, and his position as President makes things even more awkward. His Chief of Staff, Charles Bingley, is good at smoothing ruffled feathers when Mr. President's cold demeanor offends but can't do much for him in the romance department. Meanwhile, Lizzy has the hots for the President but knows he's WAY out of her league and (surprise!) misinterprets their interactions, assuming he dislikes her. I'm sure you recognize the P&P influence here.The main theme throughout that DOES ring true is the obscenely high level of scrutiny and speculation regarding the President's personal life which can and does affect his ability to govern. Public perception is a big weapon, whether it's based on truth or lies. A bizarre scandal erupts around President Darcy regarding Elizabeth and her family that results in unexpectedly strong opposition to the President's bills in Congress. (Again, this is primarily Lydia's fault. I HATE that girl in this variation!!)The bottom line is that if you just accept this as a light, fluffy read and don't try to look at the distracting illogic woven throughout the story, it's mostly a cute, silly romance. "," What a delightful find!It is hard finding a new author to take a chance on given the cost of books these days.I noticed that this political romance also included funny moments. I could not pass this up and am thrilled I took that chance.Now I want to read more from this author. I liked the banter between this couple as well as the thought bubble dialogue. The humor was also lovely. It gave this retelling its own life.I can't wait to see what happens next!denise bailey "," 4.5 rounded up to 5 stars.As I was reading this story I kept thinking about gossip concerning presidents and other politicians...even today's men and women, and how their lives are on display but then also how gossip can be used to paint those as immoral, corrupt, etc. individuals even if untrue and so many believe what they hear and/or read.We do have this modern variation beginning as did canon. Elizabeth, attending a social event, with her nouveau riche family, gets caught where she should not be and when she can't seem to get her foot out of her mouth is thought to be a stupid and not so pretty and thus an ignorable young lady by the president of the USA. But when he expresses his opinion within her hearing and God-awful Lydia uses social media to relate his words to all who subscribe to that channel of communication the stage is set to make any apologies or second chances to change his opinion almost impossible.What I did like about this is how Elizabeth is involved with bettering the world by her work with the Red Cross and how the president is forced to learn just how wrong he is about not only her intelligence and her motivations but also her beauty as sexual chemistry is thrown into their relationship.But several things work against them. He has sworn not to date while in the presidency and with all the rumors is now forced to step back. Any overtures at this point would seem politically motivated. Plus Lydia has gone on to paint an even wider gap between her sister and the president. (Guess who is helping her?) Elizabeth decides to bow out of the picture.I loved the solution the author came up with. I had an inkling that this was the only possibility but it was so well staged - much better than I had painted in my brain.Well done - and don't you love the cover -drool! "," ...and it's still as much fun as the first time. There are some truly eye-rolling moments (Mr. Collins and Charlotte Lucas and Mr  Bennet's profession), but they're mostly humorous, if not downright hilarious. Certain characters weren't emphasized, but described fairly close to canon as were the main characters. Of course, the plotlines were thoroughly modern, but developed logically and were deftly described. One reviewer would have you believe this novel is porn. This is a blatant falsehood. The sex is mostly just talked about; in only one case was it more descriptive, and that was handled really well. I guess my overall rating would be 4.875 stars. The On-A-Stick schtick (pun intended) was a little ridiculous so I took off ⅛ of a star. 😁 I absolutely recommend this book for a well-written, fun P&P variation. "

We've also got most of the Bennets, the Darcys, the Colonel, Lady C and Anne, and all the Bingleys.There are so many people crammed into just over 300 pages. Unfortunately, there are too many to have their stories given the full treatment here. This one book could easily have been four or five, or even half-a-dozen. It's a shame, as most of the characters are given an interesting twist on canon.The title sounds dramatic, but the story isn't. Because of the number of characters and romances developing, the focus keeps shifting. It starts off with Aaron Gardiner playing an important role in altering two crucial areas: Elizabeth's impression of Wickham, and Bingley's desertion of Jane. But then it moves away from Uncle Aaron as the ""deus ex machina"" to spend time on other characters, shoving the prodigal uncle off-stage. He isn't brought back until Wickham becomes a problem (again).I enjoyed so many of the sub-plots. But I was frustrated that we only got to read a few scenes happening, but then were jerked away to drop in on yet another pairing. The use of a letter exchange halfway through the story, with each letter from and to different people, was clever with a perfect sense of timing.Everybody gets a HEA ending except for Lady C, Wickham, and Caroline Bingley. This often happens in fanfic, so no surprises when that happened.Darcy overcomes his family's objections to his marriage. Elizabeth is wed in a double ceremony that involves not Jane (who married Bingley several weeks prior), but her younger sister Mary.A long epilogue details the endings for other characters, but oddly nothing again on either of the Gardiner branches, although the Bennet parents are mentioned. It's another indication of too many people, not enough time to detail them all.What the reader does get is enjoyable and worth the effort. But I feel this would have been better done as a series. It's ironic how so many authors are deliberately breaking up their stories into artificially contrived series to maximize profits....while here we have a stand-alone book that really deserved to be expanded into a collection. "," For the number of characters that get paired off in this story, there is little to no romance on the pages. It's not a case of instant love, or even a case where they spend time together but the reader just can't understand how they fell in love. No. The characters have plenty of opportunities to spend time together, and given that the characters do pair off, get married, and seem happy about it, the reader assumes they take advantage of the opportunities and fall in love. However--the reader has to assume this all because there are few pages that include conversations or interactions with any of the couples. ESPECIALLY not with Darcy and Elizabeth. In a weird way, this made each of the four to five sentence proposals not feel so out of place. If we'd had the heart melting proposal scenes, they might have been hard to believe after having not observed the growth of the relationships. So, if you are looking for a romantic P&P variation,  this is very much not for you.Like other reviews have said, there is A LOT that is covered in the book. Given the page count, that meant everything is pretty shallow and doesn't get a lot of page time. This is unfortunate and disappointing because on almost all of the storylines, conversations, events, interactions, etc. there was more opportunity to take it farther and I wanted the author to do so because I  liked pretty much everything the author put into the story. For someone who prefers the shorter page count variations,  it is saying something for me to say that I REALLY wished this had been 500+ pages.So why did I still give it 4 stars? Well, it introduced new characters that I liked and didn't ruin the original characters. It was not a repetition of the original P&P, nor did it follow similar paths as numerous other variations. I liked how the Wickam-Lydia story worked out. I liked that Lydia and Kitty (and Mr, and Mrs. Bennet) grow up. I liked that there wasn't a ton of angst and everyone gets a happy ending that I liked. Also nothing dragged and I felt no desire to skim or skip stuff. If you want romance, this is a 2 star book. If you don't, this is a solid 4 star book that I very much enjoyed reading and know I'll read again. "

My ID is LoriH, if you want to preview future books."," The minor change of Elizabeth mentioning Wickham's name to Col. Fitzwilliam during that fateful walk at Rosings' park, creates a new path for the ODC romance as it moves to London and back to Longbourn.With the Colonel's help, Darcy avoids the dreaded Worst Proposal In The World at Hunsford. Instead, he realizes he must exert himself to woo Elizabeth and convince her to agree to a courtship. In a shocking twist to canon, Anne de Bourgh makes it very clear that she is not willing to marry her cousin Darcy.Darcy goes to great efforts in his attempts to win Elizabeth's favor. He struggles to put aside his class prejudices, and is rewarded by Mr. Gardiner's assistance in establishing a better reputation in Meryton than the image Darcy had left with.Caroline Bingley makes every effort to impress Darcy, but fails completely. Unlike many JAFFs, she is not made into a true villain, merely a self-absorbed, overly ambitious social climber. It is not until she goes too far over the line of correct behavior, and is caught in public, that she receives a suitable comeuppance.Lydia, unfortunately, remains a scandal waiting to happen, and why someone doesn't haul off and slap her a good one is beyond me. Instead once again she is allowed to avoid the consequences of her actions. At no time is she remorseful or empathetic towards others for the trouble she has caused.On the good side, Lt. Denny comes up with a solution for Lydia, which allows three of her remaining sisters to sigh with relief and enjoy their HEAs. The story ends rather awkwardly, with the intimation that the last unmarried Bennet daughter has also found a suitor. It's almost a throwaway line, and felt odd. All those scenes and dialogue given to Elizabeth, Jane, Kitty, and Lydia's romances, but once again the middle sister gets almost completely overlooked.I always wonder why so much space is given to Lydia in JAFFs, who is even more dislikable than Mrs. Bennet. So much more can be done creatively with Elizabeth's other sisters (and has been). Nonetheless, this was a good variation, up until Lydia and her ""Wicky"" crash onto the scene, figuratively speaking. "," So I wondered on first finding this book if the Fitzwilliam referenced in the title was Fitzwilliam Darcy or Richard Fitzwilliam. It turns out it is Richard. In the first chapter he explains about Wickham to Elizabeth and also enlightens her regarding Darcy. She takes his words seriously and is at the parsonage with a headache when Darcy comes to proclaim his love. She refuses him but not for the reasons in P&P. He talks her into letting him court her while she remains at Rosings and Hunsford. Delightfully, their courtship progresses well and they eventually get married and live HEA.I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more books by Lorraine in the future. "," While it's a good idea -- the colonel and Lizzy have a frank conversation about Wickham and Darcy has to actually COURT Lizzy -- and I have seen it done extremely well by other authors like Elizabeth Adams, this needs much more work. Here are the problems:1. There is a disconnect between the reader and the story. The writing was such that I did not feel involved in the story nor could I feel any emotions beyond disinterest. The reader must feel involved to care and I did not. What a pity.2. The Lydia/Wickham story was contrived and jarring. This story arc served no purpose whatsoever to the book. It felt like the author had written it as a separate story before then last minute threw it into this one to beef up the word count. It didn't make any sense. That whole section could be removed and it would improve the story immensely.3. While the colonel may have been thought to be important enough for his actions to be the title, he is a very small part of the story. He virtually disappears through much of it. And that's a pity because his story could have been a truly fascinating side story in this one. Far better than the ones we got.4. The behavior of most of the characters is inconsistent. I don't mean with canon. I expect them to be different than canon otherwise what is the point in reading JAFF? I mean inconsistent throughout this book. I do not think the author had  the characters firmly established before writing and the book shows that.5. Miss Bingley shows up but serves no purpose to the story, though the author seemed to think she did. It felt like the author had plans for an actual story there but then dropped them for whatever reason.I really wanted this to be good. The rules of conversation and of society in Regency England were so prescribed that a truly direct conversation about those topics could not be had without very careful maneuvering. With a very strong rewrite, this could be better. "," A rather interesting and unique premise in this sweet variation inspired by author Jane Austen’s classic novel Pride and Prejudice by Lorraine Herschel. I enjoyed it. "," This was a very enjoyable book.  It had new solutions to old problems and the characters were very interesting.  I think any P&P reader will like this book. "," Once again I have had the pleasure of reading one of your Pride and Prejudice variations. You do good work, Lady. "

Well, the author nailed it. It truly felt like a realistic possibility.  And the complications it presented for the characters was written in a way I’ve not been privileged to read before as it was written in such a practical way.  By practical I mean the author put a lot of thought into what would really happen to the characters in both time periods.The efforts the characters had to make to change their destinies were brilliantly executed. I did not expect the solution to the HEA at all.  I loved itI’m not going to replay the plot in this review as it has already been done much better than I could.  And if I attempted it you’d be bored by my gushing over so many parts of it.Highly HIGHLY recommended. "," I can't even describe how much I loved this book. I read other reviews and somehow still did not expect it to be as wonderful and engrossing as it is.  I kept trying to put it down and then suddenly it was 3 am. I hate to force myself to get some sleep before getting up to finish. "," I loved this story so much! The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is well done. They start out wary of each other. Darcy is reluctant to engage with her at all, fearful that her presence will cause the truth about Nine Ladies to get out and wreak havoc on his life, reputation, and estate. But over time, because he is one of only four people who know the truth and only one of two she has the ability to talk to regularly, they get to know each other, and to care for each other.One the things I love best about this novel is how the effects of time travel are handled. I haven’t seen or read every time travel book or movie out there, but in the ones I have, the characters so often seem to shrug off the differences in culture, mores, manners, and technology, aside from a brief comment or question when confronted with something new or different that’s usually played for a joke—then they’re off doing their adventure. And I guess that’s okay since those stories are about something else usually. But in this story, those things are given the weight they would likely really have. It’s no joke to have everything you believe and understand about how people should act and treat each other be completely different. Or to have technology that is so vastly different from what you’re used to in ways that affect the decisions you make. As a modern, 21st century woman, Elizabeth is understandably dismayed by how women are expected to behave and the lack of respect they are granted in 1811. She’s even more horrified by what passes as medical care. These become real roadblocks to the emerging relationship between her and Mr. Darcy, and Moll doesn’t shy away from letting those things be the roadblocks that they would realistically be. I like this because it is a real conflict that can’t be easily brushed aside or solved with one conversation. I honestly wasn’t sure how things were going to resolve into a HEA.And that’s another thing that was great about this book. There were some plot points that I was able to guess at, but the ultimate resolution of the story? I did not see that coming until it was made clear. I had a solution in mind, but I was wrong. And interestingly, Moll has the characters address the solution I had come up with and dismiss it.But this is, above all, a romance, and it succeeds extremely well at that, too. I really wanted Elizabeth and Darcy to find a way to be together, and not just because they are Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy of Pride and Prejudice, but because of this Elizabeth and Darcy, because of this relationship that they built together and the experiences they shared.I really think that anyone who loves a good romance story would enjoy this book—you don’t need to be either a time travel fan or a Pride and Prejudice fan. "," Nine LadiesI was impressed by this story. A good time travel novel is hard to pull off, but Heather Moll did an excellent job. The Nine Ladies refers to a mysterious circle of stones on Stanton Moor, whose strange powers are secretly watched over by the Master of Pemberley, who is currently Fitzwilliam Darcy.  Each equinox and solstice the circle becomes a time portal at sunset. Only a few people know the secret of the Nine Ladies: Darcy, his gamekeeper Roland and the gamekeeper's son Young Henry, cousin Col. Fitzwilliam and the housekeeper Mrs. Reynolds.Elizabeth Bennet has only two family members left. She came to England to tend to her scholarly, disinterested father, who has just died. In current-day America, there is only her bitter divorcee mother, who harps continually on the need for her two daughters to aim at profitable, high-pay careers and to never trust a man. Eldest sister Jane has pleased her mother by becoming a doctor, but Elizabeth is feeling rebellious, unwilling to go for her Masters and become a CPA.On the Vernal Equinox in 2011, Elizabeth accidentally remains within the circle at sunset. She is transported back in time 200 years, to Derbyshire near Pemberley. She finds the period appalling. Women have few rights, little education, no equality in the eyes of the law. Medicine is still in its primitive stages, with doctors prone to using leeches. The rigid social dictates annoy and offend her.Darcy is shocked; it is the first time anyone has come through the portal within his memory. The start of the ODC meeting reads a bit awkwardly at first – Darcy is extremely rigid and Elizabeth very much the mouthy American – but it all works out as the story progresses. The characters ""settle into their skins"", as one would say. Darcy loosens up a bit, and Elizabeth tries hard not to make egregious errors.Ms. Moll's story involves multiple time travel trips, as well as giving Darcy the opportunity to put into practice Elizabeth's advice on how to be more sociable and less arrogant. There are several mysteries to be solved, and I especially loved the naming of ODC's first-born, which was very touching.Note that in the final chapters the sexual tension is ramped up into several detailed lovemaking scenes. Not all JAFF fans like these, but they are short in length and can be easily skipped over without missing anything that affects the plot. "

It’s refreshing to see Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet in new worthy faces other than those seen in tv or movie adaptations of Jane Austen’s classic.Secondly, this is a well-written straightforward story featuring very admirable characters even if one has known them for so long.  Elizabeth Bennet, who is the focus here, seems more courageous and strong until she is vulnerable, unsure and lovesick. Mr. Darcy is much reserved but very respectful of Elizabeth’s feelings, opinions and space.  Anne de Bourgh is surprisingly healthy and engaging in this, which is a welcome twist.The only reason for the star deduction is as much as this story is well-meant, neither much time nor pages are devoted to the love affair between Elizabeth and Darcy until the very end of the story.  Although there is an implication of Elizabeth’s growing affection and feelings for Mr. Darcy, not much is discussed about his feelings and thoughts. However, if the reader gets reconciled with the idea that this story is mostly in Elizabeth’s POV, then the misgiving can be easily overcome.A pleasant enjoyable read and convenient enough due to its brevity. "," Although the story starts and ends on a happy note,  it's the in-between  that you'll  find most interesting.  You'll  be immersed  in the ups and downs and faulty reasoning and suppositions  of Mr. Darcy and Miss Elizabeth Bennet.  Lady Catherine de Bourghe is even more  rude ,  cantankerous, and manipulative  than one can imagine.  You'll appreciate how  she's outwited by those she hoped to rule over. Enjoy! "," Cute if simple story, marred by run on sentences. Comma splices, ‘em dashes and modern language abound.  I counted 489 uses of “and” or “but” where a full stop and new sentence would have been far more readable.  It detracted and distracted from the tale. "," This story alters the Rosings scenario to give Anne de Bourgh a more important role in Elizabeth and Darcy's romance. It's always a pleasure to see Darcy's cousin have a well-developed personality, and she's delightful here.But the friendship between Elizabeth and Anne leads to a misunderstanding that threatens to destroy any chance for Elizabeth to have that HEA. Will Darcy ever get the chance to straighten things out between he and Miss Bennet? Or has his interfering Aunt Catherine ruined everything? "," This is the third book I have read by this author and I really enjoyed it. It is a delightful story with a good mix of moderate angst, misunderstandings and romance.The subject is not new in JAFF and there are a few similar books out there but after 15 years of reading JAFF, I dare say almost nothing is unique and any plotline has been done at least ten times before.In this story, there are enough original twists to keep the readers' interest, the dialogues are witty and engaging and the characters' development and dynamic are very satisfying.Also, I liked the structure of the story, it kept me interested and intrigued.The writing and editing are both very good too.Will keep following this author, hope he will write and publish more. "," A good retelling of Pride and Prejudice taking place almost entirely at Rosings. The characters are true to canon. I must admit my favorite part of the book is the delightful cover. "," I have long awaited a novel where Darcy loses his cool and dumps on Elizabeth in the same way she dumps on him and every one pays back Lady Catherine in accordance with her rudeness.  Here it is.The plot is different in some ways from canon and creatively so.  The characters are more developed and human.  At the 6 chapter, this was a 3+ star story.  Bt the next chapter, I was impressed.  It is a good story and worth reading.  Recommend! "," I enjoyed this storyline. I liked the way this was written by the author Lyr Newton.  This was an easy read. "

We are now married so I am with the love of her life for life. I live with my soul mate in Australasia and we have three pets, two cats, Darcy and Bingley and a golden lab, Honey. Like many high school students, Pride and Prejudice was assigned to me in an English literature class when I was 15. It was not my favourite book, which was true of any book I was forced to read at that period ion my life. Under protest I read it in order to pass the class. I forgot about the book until I was in my 30’s when in 2004 I found and watched, and then fell in love with, the 1995 Pride and Prejudice version made for TV in England. I purchased a copy of the DVD which has been watched more times that I can count. The tipping point was when I saw the 2005 big screen adaption of P&amp;P. Not long after I acquired and read the complete works of Jane Austen on Amazon. Reading e-books is my way of giving back to the environment. I read them all starting with Pride and Prejudice. P&amp;P is my favourite by far of all of Miss Austen's works, or any other for that matter. After I read it three of four times over, one day I wistfully said to myself: ‘it is a great pity that Miss Austen never wrote a sequel to her seminal novel.' I was searching the Kindle Store for books and for the hell of it I entered “Pride and Prejudice Sequel’ into the search bar not expecting any results. The rest is history. I discovered the myriad of JAFF books. Once I devoured all of the sequels and continuations that I could find, I reluctantly tried a variation. I had the wrong-headed belief that variations were not as good as sequels. Boy was I ever wrong! The more that I read, the more I started getting ideas and hear stories in my head, so I decided to start writing, something that I never imagined in my wildest dreams that I would ever do. Today I am the proud owner of well over 1,000 JAFF novels that I have acquired on Amazon. ‘A Change of Fortunes’ is the first book that I have written. There are a number more in the works, it seems that the more I write, the more I want to write."," One of my favorite authors "" A Lady"" has once again written a wonderful P&P variation that stars Mr. Bennet of Longbourn and his five daughters.  It all began before he married the Mrs. Bennet of canon.  We discover that he was in love with someone else!  And that someone was none other than Lady Catherine deBourgh!  This is their story.  There are many familiar characters from canon as well as situations.  You will learn about how Mr. Bennet and Lady Catherine find their way back to one another after being married to others.  I loved it!  And there is a sequel to look forward to!  Can't wait! "," This story gives a new slant to Lady Catherine's rigidity and Mr. Bennet's family life. Although they are deeply in love, they are not allowed to marry, and Catherine is essentially sold into the de Bourgh marriage by her bankrupt father. Bennet is so dismayed, he cuts ties with his old friends, the Matlocks and Darcys, and returns to Longbourn. There he is compromised by the avaricious Fanny Gardiner, who did not realize at the time that her ambition of a genteel, comfortable life, was not guaranteed unless she birthed a son.Lady C and Bennet realize that being married to others, means they will never be able to marry each other, as they had originally planned.Life at Rosings is emotionally barren for Lady C except for her beloved daughter. She never knows that at Longbourn, Fanny Bennet strove but failed to birth a son. Eventually tragedy claims their marriage, but as Bennet has cut all contact with his old friends and beloved lady, no one outside Hertfordshire knows he is a widower now.Twenty years later, Charles Bingley invites his friends - the Matlock's sons and the Darcy heir - to visit him at Netherfield, where the Bingley parents bought an estate. Shocked, the Matlocks and the Darcys must decide: should they tell their sons about Thomas Bennet and Lady Catherine's old history?But the old adage, ""the truth will out"", comes true once again. What will happen when Thomas and Catherine face one another after so many years apart? "," I loved this book from beginning to end. I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Keep them coming "," A ""what if..."" variation , wherein Mr Bennett knows the Earl of Matlock and the senior Mr Darcy as a young man, is best friends with them, and falls in love with Matlock's sister, Catherine. However, the senior Earl is a vicious and mercenary man who sells Catherine to Sir Lewis DeBourgh, breaking her heart and young Thomas Bennett's. Thomas Bennett is compromised by Fanny Gardiner, and forced to marry her. Both Thomas and Catherine endure loveless marriages until their spouses die, but it's many years before they each discover that the other is no longer married. Meanwhile, they are each thankful for the children they've had: Bennett has four daughters, and Catherine has one.It's revealed at the end of this book that there will be a sequel. That's a good thing, because there are loose ends left hanging. One is the fate of Mr Collins, who in this version is beyond ridiculous, and a terrible person as well. Another is the very predictable outcome of Lady Catherine and Mr Bennett's wedding, and that is that they will have a boy child to break the entail on Longbourn, and thus leaving the awful Mr Collins high and dry. The sinister Mr Wickham is also hinted at late in the story, so he still has some mischief to inflict.This author is a very good writer. However, in this book, as in some of her others, there is a lot of narrative, and not very much actual dialogue and interactions. It's like having a play described to you, rather than seeing the actors play their parts on the stage. For example, we're told that Viscount Hilldale, Andrew Fitzwilliam, falls in love with Charlotte Lucas, but we're never privy to how that came about. There's absolutely no romance there. I feel that the give and take between characters, all of the nuances of dialogue and interactions, is very important to a satisfying story.Also, there are several occasions where the author tries to fit in text from the original P&P, but it's used in a different situation. The result is awkward at best, and seems kind of silly. It would have been better to just create new text and dialogue, rather than to try and force text that just doesn't belong.The book is well written and well edited.  I recommend it for an interesting take on Lady Catherine, a character that we usually love to hate. Not so in this version. "," Its rare to find stories that revolve around Lady Catherine and this is the only one I know of that pairs her with Mr Bennet in their early years.  It's an interesting look into how many connections Bennet had and how many years they were kept apart by her father, their spouses, and then their stubbornness.It gave a good explanation for why Lady Catherine was so controlling and at the same time showed a Mr Bennet who wasn't indolent but instead an involved parent who poured every pence into saving for his daughters future.I enjoyed the difference in the Bingley family with the sisters not as horrible but I hated the change in Mr Collins. This is a man with no redeeming social values!Unfortunately the story ends without a complete resolution so we are waiting for part 2, which should be great since it has Wickham in it and he's always good for some evil mischief! "," This is an interesting addition to the Pride and Prejudice story.  I liked how the author inerplayed the original story and memorable lines to other parties.  It is like the P&P story for the previous generation. "," I enjoy a JAFF story that does not center on Lizzy and Darcy.  This story focus on Lady Catherine and Mr. Bennett.  It was well written and I enjoyed how their secret unfolded to the younger generation. "," A very unusual but interesting premise in this variation inspired by author Jane Austen’s classic novel Pride and Prejudice by Shana Granderson. I enjoyed it. "

Whilst there she is surprised to meet Mr Darcy, Colonel Fitzwilliam and Mr Wickham.Elizabeth is about to be astounded time and again by the events that play out in Liverpool. Events which see her undertake a night time adventure with two men she had no idea were in fact cousins!While staying at Gracechurch Street in London she had been invited by Lady Matlock to a soiree at Matlock Gardens. It was there that she was left in no doubt, by her Ladyship, that she was not a suitable wife for her son Colonel Fitzwilliam, who Elizabeth had only recently met. Too poor, was the insinuation and certainly not born high enough.After being duped by Wickham and astonished by what she overheard Mr Darcy say to his cousin, Elizabeth was delighted when within less than a week, her life changed immeasurably. A change which would find her living, albeit temporarily, only five miles from Pemberley.This is a gentle, lightly amusing tale of the developing love between Darcy and Elizabeth, with all its ups and downs.  Read more","Marie Green lives in the North of England and started her working life in the travel industry. During those years, she travelled widely in Europe and the United States. Studying for a degree in History and English Literature as a mature student, she rediscovered her love of Jane Austen characters and locations. Moving from the travel industry into education, she became a lecturer at a local college where she joined a very active writers' group and developed a love of writing stories, and discussing ideas with fellow writers.She reads Pride and Prejudice at least once a year, along with other Austen and 19th century novels. Her love of Jane Austen and the Regency period led her to discover fan fiction. After reading many of the books by fan fiction authors, she decided to write a story of her own, and has many other ideas for further stories running around in her head and eager to be written. Researching family history is also one of her favourite pastimes. She has discovered local family connections leading back to the 1700s, and continues to uncover intriguing tales of her ancestors. In her spare time, she loves walking with her husband in the Pennine Hills around her home and spending time with her four grandchildren."," I REALLY liked the Darcy that was portrayed in this book, especially after the first proposal. It follows the story of Elizabeth after an unknown uncle returns from the Americas, bestowing money on her family. She eventually helps her uncle to settle in Derbyshire where she ends up being the interest for several men. The majority of the story is Elizabeth interacting with Darcy, her uncle, Georgiana, and some friends. Wickham also has a large role in this story but it plays out well. "," the punctuation was so poor that ,  at points, it was difficult  to follow. The sentences were very often punctuated with commas instead of periods; some clauses contained segments that should have  noted with commas--in  the appropriate position--were not, or at least in the correct position in the sentence. Also, commas were missing before and after names and pronouns of addressThe story, however, was delightful! The plot was well constructed--and new-- with characters.A good editor/proof reader would do wonders for the book. I would suggest removing the story and making all the corrections or at least get better editing for future variations.And I certainly do hope Ms. Green will continue granting us many, many examples of her creative partnership with P&P and  ODC.Thank you! "," it is always fun when an author introduces an unknown to a P&P variation, and Marie Green has obliged.  namely Mr. Frederick Bennet, younger brother to Thomas Bennet of Jane Austen's invention.  Frederick's newfound existence releases the edict of entail on the Bennet's estate to cousin Collins, as Frederick is now the acknowledged heir.  good.  now for the fun info:  Frederick is an extremely successful investor and has settled a 40,000 pound dowry on each of the eldest Bennet daughters, Jane and Elizabeth.  and heavily dowered ladies would attract a bevy of suitors.  so headaches would arise.  suitors would offer.  but would there ever be a ""love match"" for these sisters???  the story traces Elizabeth's path from Longbourn to London to Liverpool, and finally Derbyshire.  Frederick Bennet has purchased Dalelands in Derbyshire; Elizabeth has found adventure through cataloging Frederick's artifacts and collections from his 30 years in Canada and New England; and they are situated but five miles from Mr. Darcy's estate, Pemberley.  so many coincidences create times together with Darcy and Elizabeth.  he and she stop an elopement, weather storms, ride high horses, accommodate cousins and sisters, remain stoic against those aiming to demean them, and often battle with angry words and raging emotions.  Derbyshire would be Elizabeth's new home with her uncle Frederick, and her heart would find its home in Derbyshire. "," Lori and Melissa have nice long reviews which help you understand what this premise is all about.Several things stood out for me. One was that both Jane and Elizabeth are gifted with £40,000 dowries by an uncle who was assumed dead. Frederick Bennet has been living and exploring in Canada, including 5 years when he lived with a Native tribe, with plans to marry one of the women. As the one reviews says one has to wonder what he was dealing in that gained him so much money. Besides helping with dowries this uncle also buys an estate in Derbyshire close to Pemberley. The second is that Elizabeth receives something like six proposals! Is it her dowry...do you think? (Of course two of those are Collins and Mr. Darcy.)However backing up. Elizabeth and her father go to Liverpool summoned via letter by an unknown person who will be arriving by ship. Mr. Bennet does guess that it is his long lost brother. While there Elizabeth meets up with Colonel Fitzwilliam, Mr. Darcy, Wickham and Mary King. The latter two draw Elizabeth into their schemes and their story is different from canon. The former two are trying to track Wickham down believing he stole £6,000 from the Colonel's older brother, the Viscount. There too is a thread that is new in JAFF (at least to me) in that the Matlocks are in serious trouble as the Viscount has gambling issues.Elizabeth is invited to live with her uncle and becomes an assistant to him in sorting out, cataloging and displaying all the treasures he has collected over the years. There are many interactions with Darcy and with his sister, Georgiana, as they now live nearby.I was not too fond of this Elizabeth. She was even more stubborn than in canon, holding onto her beliefs in Wickham's story for a much longer time. It takes more that just learning about how Georgiana was treated for Elizabeth to finally be convinced that it is Darcy who is in the right of things. Darcy does try to push Elizabeth at times, i.e., telling/commanding her not to walk out over the moors and to always take someone with her.Then Elizabeth wants to travel with her uncle back to Canada to help him tie up his businesses there and move permanently to England. Darcy is not made aware of this until the day before they are to depart. Not telling if she leaves or even if he gets to say goodbye...or don't go!I found many errors and awkward sentences in this story. A good editor is definitely recommended. "

However, the triumph of the characters was worth it.“Troubles are part of life, overcoming them is the joy of triumph.” –Lailah Gifty AkitaWhen the title of a book includes the words sins of their fathers, those sins will be discussed. Goodness. The characters grew up to be decent people despite the sins of their fathers. Their life experiences made them different people. Some may cry OOC behavior but how could they be otherwise after what they had gone through? "," Underlying this story is tales of abusive and neglectful fathers which the main characters grow up under.  Mr Darcy possibly had a son with Mrs Wickham when he was drunk .  Mr Bingley "" visited "" his daughters in the middle of the night and the girls hid this from Charles. Mr Collins and his mother were physically and emotionally abused by his father to the point that he almost died of his injuries. When his father is killed after starting a fight while drunk Collins is sent to Longbourne to be with his only living relations. Mr Bennet until then was that neglectful owner and father but decided to get more involved as he is raising his 10 year old nephew.  As a result of old man Wickhams intervention he turns his son into a good and respectful person through hard work. From this George becomes a real friend to Darcy and takes over as steward.  Because the men know Collins they come to Netherfield and stay for part of the season.  Unbeknownst to everyone Georgiana was attacked, Darcy falls off his horse and is injured which cause his moodiness!  An unfortunate series of miscommunication and partially overheard conversations Elizabeth believes that Darcy separates Bingley from Jane when its not the case. Of course her anger spins out of control and his proposal is a disaster of epic proportions! The effects of the actions of those paternal relations is felt for years and created issues of trust in most everyone.  The fact that any of these characters end up with a happy life is astounding and a result of a great deal of healing.  It's an interesting story with a terrible underlying plot and unfortunately quite believable. "," A rather sad and melodramatic re-imagining of P&P.  The fathers in the Darcy, Wickham, Bingley, and Collins families all had their moments of ""sin"", some much worse than others, as well as another father, and a mother that were also badly flawed people whose mistakes had far-reaching consequences for their children.  However, with the aid and support of loving family and friends, these children were able to become loving and well-adjusted adults.  The story spans the childhoods of all of the main characters, starting with William Collins, whose father was extremely abusive, through the times included in the original P&P.  Just when you think that his story is going to be the worst one, you read about the Bingley patriarch and what a monster he was.  This story isn't for the faint of heart.I enjoy this author as a talented writer and storyteller.  This is an interesting premise, and has a lot of opportunity for both heartbreaking and heartwarming situations.  However, since the story covers such a lengthy period of time, the romance takes a definite back seat to the more emotional family issues.  I didn't feel the chemistry developing between Elizabeth and Darcy, and when the infamous proposal at Hunsford took place, it fell flat for me, and I felt she was right to refuse him since they had very little interaction prior to that time.  None of the romances were fleshed out as much as I would have liked.Besides the lack of romance, there were some situations that seemed kind of lame, particularly the explanation of events involving Georgiana and the Bingleys, that Darcy included in the letter he gave to Elizabeth after his rejected proposal.  The circumstances seemed far-fetched and contrived.  Also, the writing in the last quarter of the book became more careless, with more modern day word usage and contractions.  It felt as if the author needed to quickly wrap things up, so she was less careful.However, it's a compelling story which will pull at your heartstrings.  I recommend it. "

My only complaint is that the ending was rather abrupt and felt jarring. "," Interesting variation centered on Col Fitzwilliam. Well written, very low/no angst for our lovers. Some scenes left dangling i.e. Darcy was promised to show up and then nothing. There was some rush to the end with summarization and telling rather than showing with action, so definitely some disappointment. "," Long have I loved Colonel Fitzwilliam. I love to read stories that feature him. This one did not disappoint. I love the premise and really love the new characters.Amalie is very sweet and Helen has a bit of pluck and spunk.The villain, Calvin Adwell, is worse than Mr. Wickham ever was. Ooooohhh so evil.I really loved this book. "," This story was very different from most Pride and Prejudice Variations. Colonel Fitzwilliam is really not a total Fitzwilliam. By birth his father is not Lord Matlock. Since he is not his father's son that makes him no longer Darcy's cousin. But neither care, been family for too long. When he is called before the Prince Regent, Fitzwilliam finds out his true identity and the new circumstances he finds himself in fills him with conflict.  He can hardly contain himself, because now he has a title, money, and land. The father of the young lady Fitzwilliam loves refuses her hand in marriage.

Aldrich swears he will hurt the one thing Richard loves the most - Helen. Aldrich plans to take her to Gretna Green, marry her, ruin her, and take her dowry. Richard goes after them, kills his cousin in a fair fight with a technique he showed young recruiters before he resigned his commission.. They continue on to Gretna Green because Helen is not sure her father wouldn't deny them again. Love prevails. "," Nor recommend.  All plot and no meaningful character interaction or dialogue.  Not worth my time or yours.  Word word word "," I loved this story, no one ever writes a book about Colonel Fitzwilliam and he such a wonderful guy.  He funny, courageous, loyal and always there when you need him. He has no money and never gets the girl.  Well this time he is still funny, handsome, has an unknown sister, and inherits a fortune and a title to boot.  Things still do not go easily for him in his love life he seems to hit a road block at every turn.  This book is fun, spicy and just enough angst to make a great read.  I hope Ayr keeps the Colonel and his wife and sister prominent in her future writing. "," I enjoyed this book mainly because Col. Fritz is a favorite character of mine.  I have not read anything from this author before this, I will certainly read more from her in the future.  Th only problem I have is,my usual pet peeve, putting the letter S at the end of forward!  I also was disappointed that it ended too soon "," I loved this. This story concentrates on Colonel Fitzwilliam. Note that Elizabeth and Darcy are barely mentioned, so do not think you are buying another E/D variation. That said, it is an engaging story about the Colonel's journey to love and and life he dreams of. I feel the reviewer that states this is porn has grossly overstated the amount of and importance of sex in this story.

(Volumes I and II)......................................Elizabeth decides to share the content of her letter from Darcy with Jane while still in London.Jane, after her reflections during the winter months, does not want Darcy to suffer unnecessarily.Impulsively, she decides to write him a letter to tell him that he was not wrong in his estimationof her feelings toward his friend.The letter changes everything…..............................This novel starts nine days after the disastrous Hunsford proposal. Elizabeth has returned to London. In her struggle to understand Mr. Darcy, she shares the content of Darcy’s letter with Jane.Elizabeth is surprised when Jane tells her that Mr. Darcy was right and that she was not in love Mr. Bingley. Yes, she welcomed him as a suitor, but he proved to have a lack of resolve. In her compassion, and because she thought of Mr. Darcy as someone worthy of admiration, Jane writes an impulsive letter to him and that is how this story starts.I realize the letter may be a shock to readers. However, if you can allow that there was more to Jane than the reader of Pride and Prejudice could see of her in the original, and if you allow that although she welcomed a suitor in Bingley, she was not in love with him, then this story may offer a possible entertaining alternative path. Look at the beginning of the story through the lenses of this premise – you will see that all instances with Jane can be interpreted from this point of view as well.This story is a Jane/Darcy story.

I am Hungarian. My first novel is Dear Sir, a Pride and Prejudice variation novel. I am a big fan of Jane Austen's novel. I have probably read about a thousand fanfiction books from Austen's created world. The idea of the book was lingering in my mind until I put it on paper. Then, from chapter to chapter I further imagined the story and the result is my book. I humbly offer it for your entertainment.My second book, More Discerning, is about how I always wanted Elizabeth to be. As I started to write this novel, I found that other characters, some in answer to Elizabeth's and Jane's differences also changed. Who am I to stop that?I already have an idea for my third novel...but I should finish the second volume of More Discerning first.I hope you will enjoy my reimaginings.P. S.: Both novels have info websites that help imagine the worlds of the novels, see link info in the first pages."," This P&P reimagining takes place after the infamous proposal in Hunsford  that Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy makes to Elizabeth Bennet.  Matters are sent in another direction when Elizabeth shares what happened with her sister Jane in London.  Miss Jane Bennet in a bold move decides to intercede on her sister Elizabeth behalf by writing a letter.  Be prepared for an unexpected outcome!!!  Many purists may not want to read this book but don't deny yourself a treat!  I thoroughly enjoyed it!!!  Well written with many HEA'S.  Get this version because it's Parts one and two combined. "," Sorry can't do it!!! This is not a variation, its a separate story. I tried I really did. It breaks my heart to think that D & E won't be together. This Jane was grasping and manipulative, inappropriate to write the letter anyway. I didn't much past the letter. If there is a sequel Darcy will be miserable and regret not pursuing Elizabeth. It will serve  him right!! "," I originally read and reviewed the two separate volumes, but when the author published an omnibus version with additions and a new chapter, I wanted to read the updated, combined version. I enjoyed this story enough to purchase the omnibus version. Here are my reviews for the two parts:Part I (ends before house party): 5 starsI really enjoyed this change of pace variation that pairs Darcy and Jane. The author does a good job of making the pairing work. I loved Jane’s letter that begins the story and Darcy’s reaction to it. I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that “opposites attract” might work in romance novels, but in real life, Darcy probably would have been more comfortable with Jane’s quiet demeanor.The author is not a native English speaker, and it shows. There are anachronisms and editing errors, but I still enjoyed this unique P&P variation.Part II (Pemberley house party): 3 starsI really enjoyed part I. Unfortunately, the second part was weighed down by too many plot lines and original characters. Darcy and Jane’s story was lost amidst so many other characters and their romances. I just wasn’t interested in the original characters who attended Darcy’s house party, although it was nice to see Elizabeth find love with one of Darcy’s friends.The pacing of part II was a problem, as it frequently dragged, and I found myself skimming in hopes that something would happen. I would have preferred that part II had been pared down to focus on Jane/Darcy and Elizabeth/Frederick with a dash of danger that Lydia would ruin them all.There were also significant editing problems, and it needed more dialogue tags. I was often confused by who was talking to whom.I loved the first part, and I think some might enjoy the second part more than I did. "

NEVER DID MR DARCY IMAGINE that it could happen to him. But it has, and by Elizabeth Bennet, the woman who first hated and rejected him but then came to love him—he believed—and agree to be his wife. Alas, theirs is a short-lived, ill-fated romance that ends nearly as soon as it has begun. No reason is given.MORE THAN A YEAR since he last saw her—a year of anger, confusion, and despair—he receives an invitation from the Bingleys to a house party at Netherfield Park. Darcy is first tempted to refuse, but with the understanding that Elizabeth will not attend, he decides to accept. When a letter arrives, confirming Elizabeth’s intention to join them, Darcy resolves to meet her with indifference. He is determined that he will not demand answers to the questions that plague him, no matter how much he wants to do just that.ELIZABETH BENNET HOLDS IN HER HEART a number of secrets, including the love for Mr Darcy which remains burning brightly. Nevertheless she is resolved to remain silent and hold fast to the secret behind her refusal, knowing it can no longer matter, believing that Darcy must surely despise her.Once they are together, however, it proves difficult to deny the intense passion that still exists. Fury, grief, and profound love prove to be a combustible mixture. But will the secrets between them be their undoing?A Short Period of Exquisite Felicity is a novel length Pride and Prejudice variation.

She began writing her own tales to amuse herself during hours spent at her kids sports practices and the like and soon discovered a passion for it. By far, however, the thing she loves most is the connections she has made with readers and other writers in various forums! Amy currently lives in Myrtle Beach with her husband and daughters, as well as three Jack Russell terriers who often make appearances (in a human form) in her books."," I found myself in tears throughout this book. Never before have I been so moved by a P &P variation. An excellent story with a few surprises. "," Usually I avoid retellings of any of Austen's works featuring the main protagonists;  but because of the strong reviews and recommendations, I gave this one a go.It was definitely worth it, and kept me glued, even though I had the horrible luck to have read just the title of a review in which there was a major spoiler, revealing the basic thrust of the story. How differently my experience would have been, save for that spoiler!!But the writing was great. It was an emotion-driven tale. Lizzy meets Darcy at Pemberley, as per the original story, and they become engaged. There is no doubt it is an exquisitely happy circumstance, but then mysteriously Lizzy calls it off, not only breaking Darcy's heart , but making something of an enemy of him and his sister Georgiana. Who can blame her, when in her eyes her brother is the best of the best?Their paths do cross again, and what follows was for me extremely satisfying because it was honest, romantic and heart-rending. Other readers might not like the intense inner examination of feelings and outward expression of love, which was basically a peeling back of months and years of events impacting our H/h's inner life.If you are like me and enjoy what I described, and don't mind that there is a long period of ""peeling back,"" followed by not only an HEA, but an extended epilogue, then this is the P&P retelling for you. I am glad I read it, and recommend it as a top-tier example of the JAFF genre. "," ""Not at all."" Three simple words that have such a profound impact.There is absolutely nothing simple about this heartbreaking, anguish-filled story that has your heart begging for release from the vise grip around it. Each chapter slowly builds unto the next with a tension, that not only affects Darcy and Elizabeth, but also you, the reader. The tightness around your heart begins, slowly squeezing, your throat constricts as tears hover on your lashes before sliding down your cheeks. The exquisite torture of their time apart and together is like a wave receding and then crashing upon the shore. It is relentless and unending. What forces have been brought to bear upon our beloved characters? Why have they been ripped from each other's arms and for what purpose?""Elizabeth Bennet, his betrothed for a hallowed and gossamer week and two days, was his no more."" (quote from the book)As the story unfolds, you are gasping at what is slowly revealed. This can't be! Why? Both Darcy and Elizabeth are so lost in their anger, doubts and regrets. Their friends and family worry for them and try to help. But is it help or hindrance? It is not for me to reveal. This is a journey well worth experiencing on your own.This is not your sweet variation to happily-ever-after. This is a story of a love that will not be crushed or beaten. It will endure to rise again...but at what price? But don't think this is all dark anguish. There are delightful moments within as you see Elizabeth's spirit rise at every attempt to intimidate her. She is glorious! Your heart will melt for Darcy even when he is being told lies and believes them. Just be prepared to let your heart and mind be consumed by this novel. It is beautifully written by an author who lays bare the human heart with such power of emotion. "," Lately I have been re-reading a lot of past favorites on my kindle in the Jane Austen fanfiction genre because the last few buys were ""good, just not great"". I read all day in my day job and so I expect much from my pleasure reading. When I heard a favorite Austenesque author, A D'Orazio, was releasing this new novel, I was primed to buy. Last night my plan was to read until I got tired and finish it tonight (because it is about 300+ pages.) Well... ""A Short Period of Exquisite Felicity"" is my very favorite kind of ""Pride & Prejudice"" reimagining... The kind where Mr Darcy is absolutely and painfully in-love with Miss Elizabeth, and she loves him but has no hope of his love being returned. And lots of wonderful twists and turns until they finally make it to their happily-ever-after that we expect and they deserve. Oh! Delicious angst from page one. And it did not let up. His devotion to her, even through his anger and hurt, was poignant and almost palatable off the page. All the canon characters are familiar and the new characters are fresh and equally strong.  I think this is the one novel that I didnot like the colonel but then Miss Austen gave us so few clues about him, not even his first name, that I found this spin on his character interesting.And my alarm went off at 6am with still 10% left on the kindle so... Today I will be walking around like a zombie and suffering from an acute book hangover -- but well worth it. This book is one I will surely re-read. I ordered the paperback copy too so I can add it to my shelves. It's that good! Warning: block out time to read. You won't want to put it down once you start. "

Will he succeed in his usual manipulation or will he finally face justice? George Wickham is eager to seize what he believes he deserves and thinks nothing of manipulating and coercing others to gain his desires. Wickham’s memory is selective, and he is adept at rationalizing his own behavior, while blaming others for any consequences from his actions. Miss Darcy unexpectedly appears and verbally challenges George in public after being inspired by the story of a strong woman. Will a lifetime of bad decisions garner dire consequences for George, or will he find a way to turn the circumstances to his advantage once more? This novella is a companion to Laraba Kendig’s book, I am Jael, retelling the story from Wickham’s perspective of Miss Darcy’s determination to bring righteous vengeance on the manipulative and cruel George Wickham.

Read I Am Jael first and follow with I Have Been Jaeled. Although there are identical overlapping (per necessity) passages in both books, this companion story is short enough that it is not tedious. Wickham’s viewpoint is chilling, particularly his opinion of female servants and his debauchery, and the end is deserved. There is reference to sexual assault in a non-graphic manner. Well written. "," OK.  So I read I am Jael and enjoyed it.  So, why read the same story line from the villains perspective?  Because the thought intrigued me and on KU, I had nothing but a couple of hours to lose.  For me,the story worked.  Majoring in Wickham added another dimension to the story.

I know that you will enjoy reading this author.  In fact, it led me to read The Banished Uncle, another great offering from this talented author. "," This is an excellent companion follow-up to, “I am Jael”.  Seen from Wickham’s point of view as to his actions and behavior, Georgianna was right:  Wickham was never going to change.  Highly recommend. "," How interesting it is to have a glimpse into the mind of a self centered person! The way they can make all about them. A worthy read.

"," It pays to be in the best shape possible when you're wrangling the largest reptiles on Earth! – Terri IrwinI read and loved the original “I am Jael” so when I saw this same story told from George Wickham’s viewpoint, I grabbed it.  Unfortunately, a lot of this very short tale was a recounting of the original.  It didn’t make the same impression as the first book.Ms. Kendig’s first books with Georgiana finding her inner strength and George Wickham finding his redemption sport lovely cover photos of flowers.

She is finally forced to acknowledge, that, in essentials, he is the only man who can make her happy.**This is a story with some sensual scenes**  Read more","“If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.” ~ Jane AustenAvid reader, scribbler of words, purveyor of food. Such is the life of a wife, mother, grandmother, and author.I write Austen-inspired romances and have a weakness for Alpha males and feisty heroines who keep them on their toes.I look forward to meeting you, between the pages."," I don't normally like the ""Bennets with secret wealth"" variants, but this was well-crafted and full of surprises. We get a version of Mrs. Bennet that is more extreme than most, but still believable. Bingley is more mature and independent, and Jane is a surprise to delight in.Darcy has a beautiful mistress who satisfies him in all ways. He has irritating relatives who constantly harass him about being unmarried and question his guardianship of his little sister. Irked, he decides to marry a woman who will appall his noble relations. Besides, he needs an heir – and then he can just leave her at home while he continues his left-handed connection.When he finds himself intrigued by Elizabeth Bennet, however, Darcy has no idea what he's getting himself into. He sees the vulgar Mrs. Bennet and her ill-mannered daughters, and happily envisions his uncle and aunt turning purple with rage. But Elizabeth and Jane are unlike their younger Bennet sisters for a reason – and Fitzwilliam Darcy will have to eat a large helping of humble pie when he finally discovers their secret. "," Darcy is looking for an unsuitable bride who will not be acceptable to his Uncle Matlock and Lady Catherine.  This brings him to Meryton where he meets Elizabeth. He's unaware that Jane and Elizabeth are daughters of the previous Mrs Bennet who was daughter, niece , granddaughter of various Earls, Marques, and even a Duke or two. This Mrs Bennet doesn't even know about this family history. She compromised the grieving widower and then moved in with her 3 daughters to make life miserable.  Darcy decides to compromise Elizabeth to add insult to injury. He mildly does this by stating they are betrothed in front of witnesses. In the meantime, he goes back to London where he discovers his long-term mistress conspired with Wickham to get Georgiana to elope and split the dowry.  Needless to say he has Miss Daphne Younge tossed out with only what she came with. No money, no jewelry, no expensive gowns!By the time he finds out who Elizabeth is, he's fallen in love with her. In this Elizabeth we find a kinder, less judgmental woman who forgives as easily as possible.Its fun and we don't have as much Caroline, Collins, or Lady Catherine as usual. "," Darcy’s character is questionable in the beginning of this story for me.  He has a “love interest” and want to marry someone his uncle will not approve of but is still a gentleman’s daughter, he does have some standards.Darcy is at the Merton Assembly and in comes Elizabeth, who he assumes is related to Mrs. Bennet and her awful daughters.  From there it gets pretty rocky.I thought the Bennet background was held back too long, well actually why Mr. Bennet married Mrs. Bennet actually.  That part of the story bothered me, I thought some parts of the backstory were too vague.Darcy’s love interest was rushed, although I could see why he did not want that public knowledge but Elizabeth knew.I enjoyed the story but I felt the beginning of their marriage was too compliant for me.  Then I felt the rest of story after they married just felt a bit too rushed for me.  There was a lot going on but I did not connect to it. I will not say what happened but overall our dear couple was happy.  Jane was a surprise. "," I really enjoyed reading this version of our beloved “Pride and Prejudice” story!  It took a lot of turns in the storyline, but it really ended in a happy way!  I really appreciated that Mrs. Bennet was not who we thought she was!  And Darcy was more advanced, which at first, irritated me, but I got used to the idea, because when we think about it, none of us are perfectly clean, sexually anymore.  This book does have a few sex scenes in it, but they are a lot more clean than many books these days.  I am glad about that, for as an old lady, any sex scenes at all are just plain boring to me and I either don’t read such books, or skip those pages altogether!  What a waste of time they are, in my humble opinion!  I did love the circumstances of Jane and Elizabeth’s lives!  That alone made this book a fun read!  I highly recommend this book to those who just love a good story! "," Seems to be quite of few books being released which may be in competition to present Darcy in his worse light.In this story Darcy compromises Lizzy, shows her how little she means to him and he is none to gentle during her night time “duties”. The writing is good but I couldn’t really believe his turn around AND she believing his turn around so easily. We get lots pages describing and showing us how little empathy or care he has for Lizzy. We don’t get as many pages convincing us of the miracle turn around.I understand how Lizzy is treated was considered ok and normal for the Regency period but Jane Austen’s version of Darcy is much nicer so forgiveness for this Darcy should be harder than for Darcy in Pride and Prejudice.

While the search is going on, Elizabeth was tasked by her father to take care of the family, as there isn't anyone else Mr. B could rely upon. In this story Jane is blind, from a riding accident long ago, but Bingley falls in love with her anyway. Having Charlotte be a close friend to Jane, as well as to Elizabeth, was a masterful touch.Elizabeth adroitly pushes Mary forward as the only Bennet sister interested in marrying Mr. Collins. Lydia is running wild, however, and in her usual stupid fashion becomes indebted to a lecherous old widower in the area. It turns out he and Wickham were engaged in a plot against the Bennets, but with the help of Mr. Darcy, both villains are defeated.Darcy convinces Bingley to return to Netherfield, and the HEA ending commences. This time it's a triple wedding, with Mary and Mr. Collins added.I enjoyed this story, but Ms. Dixon's dialogue in this story wasn't particularly interesting or witty. Other P&P authors have a better ""ear"" for Austen's incise, sparkling dialogue, such as Rose Fairbanks and Stanley Michael Hurd. Still, it's a pleasant, low angst story, and a couple of hours went by pleasantly with it. "," Elizabeth to the rescue plot. A thrilling read with a lot of warmth.Mr Bennet had passed and left Elizabeth with the burden of caring for the rest of the family. Was she to be the sacrificial lamb or may a knight in shining armour come to her rescue?A year-long search for the heir ensued but he proved difficult to find. When he was discovered, Elizabeth would have preferred it to be impossible but she was nothing if not resourceful and she was not without friends...An intriguing twist to Jane added spice to this otherwise chaste read. Although it did contain a steamy scene, it was in the literal sense rather than the abstract. (You will understand what I mean when you read the book ;)Recommend! "," After Mr. Bennet's death, Collins rushes to Longbourn to get a bride and Mrs. Bennet pushes Lizzy on him since Jane is blind from an illness as a child.  Mary really likes Collins and Lizzy talks Collins into taking herself and Mary to Rosings and let Lady Catherine choose his wife.  Smart girl Lizzy.  Of course Darcy and the Colonel were there and things got dicey when Darcy takes a liking to Elizabeth.  Lady C says no to Mary due to Darcy and Lizzy....and so it goes back to Longbourn.  Charles is in Netherfield of course with his to ""wonderful"" sisters....It has a HEA but it was not fast and certain for a while. "," An average book. The style of writing was up to the author’s normal easy to read style. But the plot and the characters weren’t very interesting. The new bad guy is taken cared of but Wickham is not. Darcy tells him he’s going to prison if he upsets Darcy again. So in the future of this story must either go straight, which seems unlikely or do something drastic to deal with all his debt that Darcy owns. I would worry about being killed by Wickham or kidnapping Lizzy or one of their kids.Average book. "," Another great story from P.O.Dixon. I have read most of her stories. This one started with Elizabeth being charged with the responsibility of her family after her father is gone. There is a search for the heir apparent and it takes time. He is found eventually and he wants to marry her and she does not. She sees her sister’s interest in Mr Collins and she concocts an idea of bringing herself and her sister to go with Mr. Collins to Lady Catherine for her to solve who he should choose. Here Elizabeth meets Mr Darcy. I highly recommend this book to a Jane Austen fan fiction lover. "," 3.5 starsYes, the story is well written, but is it a story that needed to be written? None of the characters is more than skin deep and nothing in the low-angst plot particularly grabs my attention. If you’re looking for a quick read, this is for you. If you’re looking for a story that will stay with you, I fear this isn’t it.  I’ve enjoyed other works by this author, but sadly this one didn’t speak to me.I’ve added half a star because I like the relationship between Jane and Charlotte. "," This variation is prefect for a rainy afternoon. The plot is simple, what if Elizabeth meet Darcy for the first time not at the assembly?  How would their relationship evolved? There is a subplots evolving Elizabeth as a matchmaker between Mary and Mr Collins.  Some of characterizations were surprisingly different than what was expected.  It's well written, fast moving, low angst story. "," It's cute. There's nothing particularly wrong with it. It's just nothing but fluff. All problems are solved nearly as soon as they're introduced. The characterizations are shallow and the dialogue simplistic. The premise of Elizabeth sacrificing herself for her sisters at the behest of her father could have been interesting if it were given the proper development but it was all resolved before Elizabeth shed nary a tear.

As circumstances continue to bring the two together—from Hertfordshire to Rosings Park to the seaside town of Brighton—he finds he is unable to tame his desire for the lady who has stolen his heart.Do Darcy’s efforts to win Elizabeth succeed, or does his sworn enemy lead her to the altar?From the award-winning author of An Arranged Marriage and The Journey  Read more","Jan Hahn is fascinated by Jane Austen, 19th Century England, and true love.

In her dream world, she lives in England in a place called Pemberley."," This was an enjoyable story that deviates from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. That being said, I was disappointed in Lizzy's lack of sense over Wickham's secret engagement. In her overwhelming prejudice against Darcy, she lost all of her ability to think about how wrong the entire agreement between them was in Recency England. Mary should have been reading sermons and morals in her ear. When in Hunsford, meeting Darcy again was not high on her list other than she could not deny her feelings when she was around him. When she hears all the news about Wickham and Mary King, that should have awaken her to Wickham's no good self completely, not apologizing to him for his indiscretions. Darcy's proposal was poorly executed, but when she tells him she has an understanding with another that's a secret, Darcy at least started thinking of who that could be. But since Elizabeth has not been told of Wickham's wicked propensity to lie, cheat, gamble, and ruin young ladies, he doesn't even give Wickham any thought. The tonic that Lady Catherine gives everyone but, Elizabeth, Darcy, and Colonel Fitzwilliam, makes everyone sick in both Rosings and the parsonage. Charlotte is the most sick, has a miscarriage, and develops a cough that if it settles in her lungs could cause death. Darcy's doctor is brought from London, because the local doctor started leeches to cure her. Both Darcy and Elizabeth are appalled at this ancient practice. Getting better, but weak and coughing, the doctor suggests that she is taken to Brighton . Lizzy and Maria are to accompany her, and Lady Catherine has given them her summer house, Waverley, to stay in while they're there. Darcy convinces Collins to go for a short while to see that he wife is settled, but his real reason for this is so that her can stay also. He cannot give up on Elizabeth. The military is here in Brighton including the company in command of Colonel Forster. Lizzy sees Wickham strolling around with young ladies, one being her sister. She's trying to stay away from him, because she has finally put some of his not so neat characteristics together, and she doesn't like what she sees. On evening while all the company was gathered at Waverley, she and Darcy debate about the lines in one of Wordsworth's poems. She tells him he's wrong, and she will get her book to prove it. When she picks up her book, the letter that she refused to take at Hunsford is stuck in the front. This time she'll read it. She never comes back downstairs, because after reading about why he hates Wickham, she is completely mortified and embarrassed that she defended a useless man and condemned a good man in her blind prejudice. At the Ball given by Colonel and Mrs. Forster, when Elizabeth tells Wickham that the secret betrothal is over, to spite her, he has the colonel announce their engagement. Colonel Fitzwilliam and Darcy are in the audience. When Elizabeth wants to say something, she tells the crowd that there is no betrothal between her and Wickham and that she told him that this evening. Darcy leaves on his horse and doesn't return home to Waverley. When Colonel Fitzwilliam finds him, Darcy is torn between leaving Elizabeth Bennet for good, or going back to win her love. By the time the good colonel has set him straight, Darcy returns to Waverley. Entering Waverley, he hears someone crying on the lounge chair on the terrace. He stands there quietly and discovers that it is Elizabeth. He wants to just hold her and comfort her, but sheen she hears him, she runs past him to her room. When he arises from his short sleep, he realizes only Mr. and Mrs. Collins are downstairs. When he asks if Maria and Elizabeth have gone out, she tells him that Maria is visiting Lydia, and Elizabeth is walking the beach until the coach comes to take her home to Longbourn. Hardly able to speak when Charlotte tells him that she has brought disgrace to him and Waverley, she must leave. He's out the terrace doors to find Elizabeth. When she sees him coming towards her, she tries to avoid him. He tells her she can leave Brighton, but he will never leave her. Seeing that he still loves her and she him, Elizabeth tells him that she'll marry him. Their joy was to last from the time to walk from the beach through the terrace doors. Lydia had been thrown out of Webster House by the Forsters. Lydia had spent the night with Wickham in her bed chamber. When Elizabeth talks to her, this was not the first time Lydia had allowed him lover's duties, and Elizabeth was sure Lydia was pregnant. Colonel Fitzwilliam and Darcy go to Colonel Forster the next morning. Forster doesn't care what happens to Wickham, because he wants him gone. He rightly expects his wife allowed the dalliance besides favoring Wickham herself. The first talk with Wickham didn't convince him to marry Lydia, but Darcy alone faced him the next day, and Wickham decided with a little help from Darcy, monetary and otherwise, that he'd marry Lydia. Five days later, Lydia and w "," Marriage in Regency times was the rock that built Society's foundation. Not only was it the most important step in a young woman's life, the union could advance her family's social standing and wealth. Throughout Jane Austen's novels we are shown the maneuverings of families to obtain advantageous alliances for their children, so when we see the secret engagements in ""Emma"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"", and their outcome, we know the risk and scandal that can ensue. With this in mind, I am both curious and uneasy by author Jan Hahn's choice of ""The Secret Betrothal"" as a title of her new novel. Furthermore, in this reimagining of Pride and Prejudice, she has boldly chosen to explore what would happen if Elizabeth Bennet entered into one herself! Whatever would possess our favorite Austen heroine to take this risk--and what would Mr. Darcy do to save her from such a folly?For reasons I shan't give away here, Elizabeth must keep this betrothal a secret and when she was told she could tell no one, not even her beloved sister, Jane:""...she felt a chill crawl up her back....Although he lacked fortune, it was due to no failing on his part, and he had the promise of an adequate future awaiting him. But the possibility of waiting two years provoked a sigh from deep within her. He had warned Elizabeth that they must avoid paying close attention to each other when in public so as not to raise talk among the gossips of Meryton. Being a sensible woman, Elizabeth knew that was necessary as talk of matches and mating was primary among Hertfordshire society. Still, it did not set well with her.""  (p.63)A chance meeting at Rosings Park, Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth re-new their acquaintance and he comes to find out soon after his unpropitious declaration of love that she is already engaged. Secretly engaged! But he cannot comprehend why such an intelligent and fine a creature as Elizabeth would allow herself to enter into such an agreement. (Me either. Why, Elizabeth? Why? But of course, that frustration is what we are designed to feel.) Through a comedy of errors, the two are thrown together once again to aid the inhabitants of both Hunsford Parsonage and Rosing Park who have all taken ill after partaking in Lady Catherine's apothecary's prescribed tonic, helping Elizabeth change her former prejudices against Darcy. Meanwhile, as the weeks pass and Elizabeth receives scant letters from her secret amour, but continues to hear troubling news regarding his behavior from her youngest sisters, Elizabeth further questions her predicament. Not long afterward, Darcy's physician suggests Mrs. Charlotte Collins might best recover at the seaside, so off to Lady Catherine's Brighton home they go. There at Waverly, the story really heats up with some very sweet, romantic scenes along the ocean's edge.""Why did I not recognize Mr. Darcy's true character earlier, long before I pledged myself to the one man he could never forgive?"" At that moment, Elizabeth realized she truly loved him. She loved Mr. Darcy, and it was too late.She rose to her knees and leaned out the window, allowing the wind to softly drift through her nightgown, causing her hair to blow from her face. How she yearned to reach him, to tell him how greatly she regretted all that happened!Unexpectedly, the figure on the beach ceased his pacing. Accented by the moon's brightness, Elizabeth could see him turn to cast his gaze toward Waverly. She became aware that most likely he could see her outline, that the candle behind her must be illuminating her figure in the window. He did not move but stood absolutely still, staring at her. Neither of them moved until a sudden gust blew through the window and quenched the candle. Now there was darkness.Elizabeth watched the figure walk out of the light, and although she kept her vigil at the window for some time, he did not return."" (p.215)I declare, I was most inelegantly chewing my nails at this point.In ""The Secret Betrothal"", award winning author Jan Hahn explores the heights and depths of a secret engagement and takes us on a frustrating, breathless, sentient and oh, so satisfying ride. I love all Jan Hahn's previous works and have been anticipating her latest offering for months. This was worth the wait! Originally published on-line as a shorter story called ""The Engagement"", this published work has undergone a thorough concept edit, tightening the story and expanding where the on-line story lacked. As always, Hahn writes excellent romance, but I did not relish that Elizabeth and Darcy did not take the straightforward approach to solving their quandary. But then that would have been a totally different story and a bit of angst in Austenesque fiction is most deliciously, tantalizing. ""The Secret Betrothal"" felt authentic enough to Austen & Regency times. I am a sucker for happily-ever-afters. Fans of Jan Hahn will surely inhale this book, and those new to her work should add this to their to-be-read list--sooner than later. "," Very entertaining variation with well developed storyline. Elizabeth's stubborn personality rendered her stupid to involve herself with the villain and Darcy's pride as usual had him struggling through his relationship with Elizabeth. The minor characters played their parts well, only leaving the aunt Augusta's character without a conclusion/ending. Very entertaining read. Enjoy. "

Despite her resentment of him, Miss Elizabeth Bennet works with Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy to uncover the true culprit and save the reputation of her friend from ruin. In order to succeed, Elizabeth will have to overcome her pride, misunderstandings, and her growing love for Mr Darcy. A Lover's Fine Eye is a Pride and Prejudice variation novella with humour, mystery, a little steam and a happy ending.  Read more","Lyndsay Constable has been a passionate reader since her early teen years and frequently selected books that could be successfully hidden behind the person sitting in front of her in class. Originally from North Carolina, she attended both North Carolina School of the Arts and SUNY Purchase for dance. She currently lives in Virginia with her husband, child, dog, cat and a small murder of crows who refuse to become friendly with her despite all of the peanuts she has given them. Whatever, she’s not bitter. "," I loved it.  The funny bits were mildly shocking for the time, but honestly just hilarious for modern readers to see a bit more of the Regency era than is usually portrayed.  It's all really well done.  The mystery, the artsy jewelry, and the still very real romance, all done completely differently from all other variations I have read, including multiple new but historically accurate details.  The plot is NOT a retelling of the plot we already know.  Instead, it assumes we know the first half or so of Pride and Prejudice, then builds on a what-if changing everything up.  Don't worry, there's still a happy ending, but some pretty interesting surprises along the way! "," I really enjoyed the interaction between Darcy and Elizabeth, as well their fun sleuthing adventures in this unique variation. Written in Elizabeth’s POV, I wish there some explanation about Darcy’s bouts of silence and distance. No Hunsford/Rosings, but Wickham is present in a different way. Whether he is up to his canon tricks with Lydia is not mentioned. "," Entertaining variation that is well done -- written well, well developed storyline with history too! An excellent short read that was enjoyed. Highly recommended. "," The plot was unique! It’s very different from other variations so it’s like a breathe of fresh air. Loved the interactions between Elizabeth and Darcy. "," Interesting. The relationship between E&D progressed nicely. The angst was low. I enjoyed this caper. I will say that Elizabeth would likely have not been out alone as much in London despite the written excuses to allow for such behavior. My only disappointment was the lack of mention of Georgiana's choice and the destination of the opal ring. "," This was a light and entertaining mystery that has ODC (reluctantly) working together to uncover a thief.Elizabeth’s trip to Hunsford is diverted to London when Maria Lucas becomes ill during the trip and is unable to continue on to her sister’s home. Elizabeth decides to stay with her aunt and uncle and maybe help Jane to discover Mr Bingley and resolve the reasons for their separation. On a trip to a high end book store she and Jane encounter Miss Georgiana Darcy and Mr Bingley. Elizabeth befriends Georgiana while Jane and Bingley renew their apparent fascination with each other.Georgiana is so pleased with their new friendship that she manages to have Jane and Elizabeth invited to an exclusive annual ton ball. Lady Chinington, the hostess, gives away her previous year’s paste jewelry during the ball that the guests must hunt for and then wear for the dancing. Elizabeth being uninterested in such things decides to hide out in the library until the hunt is concluded.While in the library Elizabeth becomes interested in a book on the top shelves that has some interesting illustrations of men and women engaged in intercourse (not the talking kind!). She also finds two jewelry boxes on top of the book which she takes for hidden paste jewelry. When someone surprises her by entering the library she leaves out the window not wanting to get caught with the book. Darcy finds her in the yard and offers to return the book for her. In gratitude she gives him one of the boxes for Georgiana in case she had come up empty handed during the search activity.Unfortunately when Georgiana wears the jewelry she is accused by Lady Chinington of theft. The second piece found by Elizabeth was not worn due to its odd appearance, so Elizabeth is not likewise accused. It is a painting of an eye set into a brooch that Darcy describes as a “lover’s eye.”Darcy must clear Georgiana’s good name and the brooch seems to be a clue to the identity of the true thief. Elizabeth insists on aiding her friend, much to Darcy’s consternation and the chase is on. This is a fun read finding out how ODC manages to work together to find the (surprisingly!) guilty party. "," This story opens with Elizabeth on the first leg of her journey to visit Charlotte, with Sir William and Maria. Circumstances cut that trip short and Elizabeth ends up staying in London together with Jane, at the Gardiners, never making it to Kent. A clever recap gives us the history of what occurred until that point.While out shopping for new music, a chance meeting brings not only Elizabeth and Miss Darcy face to face, but also Bingley and Jane! Moving ODCs onto paths of their mutual romances.An invitation to a ‘bizarre’ party in London, sets the stage for the intrigue aspect of this story. Determined to clear Georgiana’s name Elizabeth and Darcy, at times disagree, at others collaborate in their stratagems to find answers!The piece of art at the center of the story has an interesting history in regency and is a clever tie-in to the story.This story is a mix of sweet romance and enough mystery to keep the reader engaged. This third offering from LC, cements for me her enjoyable writing style.  I admit, I figured out the culprit early on, but that didn’t take away from watching E&D interact and fall in love. It may be a shorter novel and therefore a quick read, but it is entertaining and a great little escapism for JAFF lovers.One scene I missed and would have liked to read, which was only ever so slightly alluded to was Bingley’s confronting Darcy with his anger. Another would have been Caroline’s more detailed reaction to her realization what the future will hold for her, but I love seeing her get comeuppance.I received a free copy of this book for my honest opinion.

"B08PCGJXCW","Pride Under Good Regulation : A Pride and Prejudice Variation","Eselle Teays 
Author","Eselle Teays Publisher; 2nd edition","Y","2.99","167,775","2020-11-30","286","4.1","362","The Bennet family of Longbourn, Hertfordshire, had long been known to its neighbours as exceptionally learned though eccentric, but was tolerated because the first Bennets settled there more than four hundred years before, just after the great plague. Both the grandfather and father of the master, Mr. Thomas Bennet, married blue-stocking wives from the Continent. These circumstances had a profound effect on Mrs. Bennet and her five daughters. Because of this broader worldview, the Bennet family was more aware of, and affected by some historical events of the period far outside the twenty-four families around Meryton than what one would expect of minor gentry in the backwater. Elizabeth Bennet had a superior mind and the self-assurance of a modern young woman; Mr. Darcy, the too proud master of Pemberley, Derbyshire was properly humbled by Mrs. Bennet during their first meeting. How would the courtship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go under these different scenarios? How would Mr. Darcy behave when his pride was under good regulation?If you stripped away the changed circumstances, the characters would behave fairly similarly as in canon. If you are looking for extra angst or extra thrills, you will be disappointed. Pride and Prejudice has been classified as a comedy of manners. It is of course a huge challenge for even a seasoned writer to have anywhere close to the genius of Jane Austen to dissect and depict Regency manners with such a sharp insight. The ‘manners’ part of the Regency era was particularly difficult for a twenty-first century first-time fiction writer to emulate. In fact, the reader may detect some modern sensibilities in the Elizabeth in this story: self-assurance, resourcefulness, independence, etc. Hopefully, this story offers some amusing bits to make it a fun read. All verifiable historical characters, buildings and events appearing in this story are borrowed purely as vehicles in a work of fiction, but as much respect as possible is paid to the historical accuracy (as obtained through brief internet searches and well-researched references) in the description of these entities. Chapter notes are provided where appropriate for those who are interested.As of May/June 2021, the whole story has been revised - errors largely corrected, the length slightly shortened to improve the flow of the story, and a few extra chapter notes added.  Read more","Eselle Teays has been an Austenphile for too many years to count. She discovered Pride and Prejudice variations and fanfiction several years ago and has read and enjoyed hundreds of them. One day, she realized that there was this one angle that had not been explored. Like the researcher that she is, she jumped on it right away. The result, “Pride Under Good Regulation” was published in 2020. She thought she would never have the inspiration to write another, but she was wrong, The second novel, “Such Novel Notions” is another of her attempts to write about something that has been hitherto scarcely explored in this very much loved, well canvassed genre. Readers in their reviews have asked for a story with angst and the Bennets being poor. The third story, “From the Hedgerows to Windsor” answers these challenges and will be published on Kindle on June 15, 2023. This story, like the previous two, has many historical elements and a plot never before attempted by any other authors in this genre, Unlike the previous two, this one offers many more plot twists and turns, and angst, as mentioned, but it is balanced by an equal measure of humor and laughter. One thing that never changes is that the characters are portrayed as close to canon as possible."," I enjoyed the historical notes in this book. I did find that some of the grammar was incorrect and some of the sentences were stilted and unrealistic, but overall it was a very enjoyable pride and prejudice variation. "," I enjoyed the storyline but the authors notes continually interrupted the flow and immersion into the story.  I almost stopped reading multiple times due to the frustration of the authors notes. Also plot points should be in the story not authors notes!! "," This light hearted adaptation is focused more on the modernization and industrial development of England than on the same old Class divide dramatics. It makes for a fresh and fun new twist on a beloved classic. "," While it's a wonderful idea to integrate real people from Regency times as well as new inventions and cultural changes during that era into a variation of Pride and Prejudice, this particular story is weighed down too heavily by it all.On the plus side, those who enjoy no-angst stories will like this more than I did. Darcy and Elizabeth get a lot of page time together, which is always popular--at Oakham Mount, Netherfield, Longbourn, London, and Pemberley. I did find many of the historical details and notes accompanying each chapter interesting.The first section give us a full background of the Bennet and Gardiner families--pretty dry stuff that doesn't pull the reader in. The story that finally emerges swipes virtually every obstacle from the original plot and adds no new ones of real significance.Mr. Bennet, Mr. Gardiner, and Mr. Philips took steps to legally break Longbourn's entail years ago, though Mr. Collins has trouble grasping that fact. The family is known by the locals to be quite wealthy (and are even richer than their neighbors suspect). Mr. Bennet is more responsible about the management of Longbourn and an active parent. Thanks to her in-laws, Mrs. Bennet is educated and actually sensible. She is in agreement with her husband that none of their daughters should wed until age twenty-one, and Lydia and Kitty are not out in society yet.Elizabeth is the epitome of a ""Mary Sue"" : She's a prodigy in several areas. She speaks multiple languages. She's an inventor. She's a sharp shooter. She sings like an angel and plays the pianoforte with such feeling her listeners are moved to tears. She is full of charm, wit, and beauty. In short, she's too perfect.In addition to everything else, she's insightful. When she hears Mr. Darcy insult her at the Meryton assembly, she wisely does not react or spread the tale. When Caroline Bingley tries to intimidate her, Elizabeth recognizes the lady's root problem and gently prods her to rethink her priorities, inspiring an immediate turn-around.Elizabeth also doesn't for a second believe Mr. Wickham's usual bid for sympathy. He does present the only potential problem in this novel. However, even as the reader learns his devious plan, we know how many different road blocks are in place to prevent him from succeeding, making it a very watered-down threat.Darcy overcomes his reservations much earlier than in canon, as he and Elizabeth have a comfortable, amiable relationship almost from the start. There IS that insult before they actually meet, but he realizes how mistaken he was about the lady and her family even before leaving the assembly. Later, he worries how his uncle, the earl, will take the news that he plans to marry a woman outside their London social circle, but again, considering the altered circumstances in Elizabeth's family, the reader never perceives this as a serious concern (and it isn't). Even Lady Catherine gets de-fanged quickly.Unfortunately, the writing itself has issues too. Repetition. (Two examples: I think Mr. Gardiner's importance to Great Britain's war efforts is explained in detail at least four times. So is the fact that the earl has made painstaking preparations for Darcy to choose a bride in London.) Lots of telling rather than showing. Many glaring grammatical and editing errors.With neither engaging writing nor a plot that provides obstacles for Elizabeth and Darcy to overcome, this book never develops any momentum. Although I applaud the author's desire to add more history into a JAFF story, I wish the result was more entertaining.Content is clean. "," The author did a lot of research for this novel; unfortunately, she wanted to show off all her knowledge, so she included EVERYTHING she learned about the era.  That's a big enough sin, but she's wrapped Elizabeth up with the untold cultural references and has created a precocious monster. She's not only educated, but a prodigy.  At the tender age of six, she transcribed German folk tales (two years before the Grimm brothers). She determined (at a young age) that a certain plant's roots weaken bridges; landowners far and wide hailed her discovery.Surely I jest?  Have a look: ""“Good day to you, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy.  I see that you have a goosey drumstick infestation problem,” responded Mr. Bennet. “Yes, Miss Elizabeth alerted us to the problem, and we found the plants right away once we knew what we were supposed to be looking for.  The Meryton millwright who repairs bridges told us that Miss Elizabeth was the one who discovered the plant in a similar bridge problem when she was just a little girl.  You must be mightily proud of her,” answered Mr. Darcy with a smile, as if he had been equally proud of the young botanist. “Ah, yes.  Lizzy was just eight years old.  She found goosey after another wrecked bridge like this one, and it turned out that she was the first person to have sighted this plant that apparently was accidentally imported from the East.  She even came up with the Latin binomial nomenclature for the plant. Allium anseris, she called it.  You can find it properly registered in the records with the Linnean Society.""  More recently, she invented the raincoat and composed music to accompany an obscure Irish poem.  And she dreams:  Her family has a Pennsylvania stove, but Lizzy is one better than Ben Franklin:  ""That afternoon he found a new favorite look on her when she placed a finger on her chin, thinking and then with the most luminous brightness in her eyes, suggested that a glass front added to the Pennsylvania Fireplace would quite dramatically transform the square box from a practical stove to  be also aesthetically pleasing. Then her face got pensive in the next second but the passion in her eyes did not get even a little diminished, and said,”'I know it is not possible now, but someday, someone will discover how to make glass that will not crack in a stove.'”  When not improving the universe, she also mends books; however, after shooting a man ""she did not trust her present agitation to be able to treat the great Gutenberg Bible with the care and respect that it demanded.  Besides, in her current mental state, she did not feel that she could read the Latin verses of the Bible as she always read what she was mending.  Instead she donned a pair of clean silk gloves and selected Shakespeare’ First Folio.""  --As one does.  The trouble with paragons is that they're boring.  Instead of reading about three-dimensional characters, we're reading about Care Bears.  Unfortunately, Caroline has been Care Beared: she reformed her entire character after one five-minute walk in the garden with Lizzy.  I still have 40% of the book ahead of me.  Darcy and Lizzy are engaged, Caroline has been neutered, and others have been vanquished.  I can only assume the back 40 will be a continuation of little plot progression amidst paragraphs of dialogue, such as this:“I was coming back to the house from vocal practice on the edge of the west field.  Buc was with me and I did not go off our property and so I did not think having Johnson to come with me was necessary, but I brought my satchel with my pistol in it in case a witless pheasant sauntered into my path, which had happened several times before.  When I was walking by the twin oaks just on the other side of the hedge, [character X] approached me with his usual too smooth manners.  I was immediately put on guard because of the time of the day and our well-known rule of not having militia officers visiting Longbourn uninvited.  I grabbed my loaded pistol in the satchel which is always primed when I am out.  He kept moving closer all the while spewing ungentlemanly diatribe.  I kept moving away from him.  I was anticipating his attack when he indeed advanced quickly toward me reaching out his arm to grab me.  I evaded him and called Buc to my aid.  Good Buc immediately jumped at [X]'s leg and tore into his breeches and would not let go.  [X] pulled out a knife from his boot to try to stab it.  I could not allow him to harm my precious Buc and pulled out my pistol and shot at his dagger all while he held it in midair.  I have never ever before cocked and aimed my pistol this fast and honestly did not expect the bullet to hit anything since I was in such a fright for Buc!  Somehow the bullet found purchase on [X]’s head and he uttered such a hellish scream that I am convinced he was mortally wounded.  I did not wait to find out because I was a coward and ran all the way back to the house with Bucky right next to me.  I never would have thought that I would shoot my pistol at a living person, and yet I grabbed the pistol as soon as I felt that he was a threat!  I only wanted to use it to defend myself against wild animals and rabid dogs, or to hunt pheasants!  I am a murderess!”  It really is that painful. A good editor would have steered the author in a better, dare I say less pompous? direction.  She would have suggested conflict, but most importantly, she would have suggested imperfect characters who are capable of growth and reflection.Reflections on the back 40:Spoiler: There is still no conflict.Spoiler:  Mrs Bennet invents Beef Wellington.Another spoiler: “Let me give an unsolicited hint to boundless marital bliss: you would do well to add water closets to your homes.  Lizzy is quite enamoured with these new-fangled features in our townhouse.  She is reading about houses in Zurich because some of those houses have water-closets that were based on the ones in twelfth century castles that carried waste into the moats.  She has already picked out a book on the Roman Aqueduct for fresh water and the Cloaca Maxima system for waste managements.“ "," I enjoyed this. Yes, the Bennets are over the top great but actually this was still written in a fairly modest way that did not smack you in the face. Sometimes you need a break and this story was sweet and occasionally laugh out loud funny. Does drag in the end and some errors but I enjoyed it. "," Extremely different than any other pride and prejudice variation I have read, with great concentration on maintaining the characters personalities yet giving them more erudite upbringing. I really enjoyed the notes sections throughout the book which explain where the author came up with some ideas and historical evidence of particular characters and nouns. How do you recommend this book to any pride and prejudice fans. "

Author","None","Y","3.99","333,985","2018-06-28","338","3.8","212","Charles Dickens meets Jane Austen in this retelling of the historical classic, Pride and Prejudice. Jane and Elizabeth Bennet are daughters of a country squire hoping to find love. Charles Bingley and Fitzwilliam Darcy are best friends and two of the most eligible bachelors to have visited the small town of Meryton in years. While this quartet struggles to find happiness and romance within the confines of Regency Era England, those who serve them struggle to survive. All the while, an evil sociopath lurks in the shadows impacting all those with whom he comes in contact. How those spared from this destructive force react to those who are less fortunate will reveal the virtuous from the apathetic. A portrait of the dichotomy between the wealthy and the poor, Courtship and Corruption, paints life using every available shade of emotional color.  Read more","Cinnamon Worth is a San Diego native who is also the youngest of ten children. Growing up, she would listen to her siblings’ tales of shenanigans and escapades. Although she did not share her older siblings daring quest for adventure, she did discover that through imagination she could find all the excitement she craved from the safety of her room. She discovered a love of reading at a young age and firmly believed that a good book should strive to make the reader feel uplifted. She was later shocked to find that nearly every English teacher she would study under disagreed with this philosophy. After countless hours reading assigned novels that included tragedies, melodramas, and modernism, Cinnamon was eventually convinced to admit that a good book does not require a happy ending. She does, however, strongly advocate for one.In college, Cinnamon met her Prince Charming and then promptly left him to pursue an opportunity to study abroad in the beautiful English countryside. Fortunately, her Prince was a patient man who waited for her return, and he has since spent nearly 25 years teaching her the meaning of love, showing her the World, helping her to raise two wonderful children, and encouraging her to pursue her dreams. Cinnamon enjoyed a long career in public sector finance, but she was delighted to leave the corporate world behind in 2014 to focus her efforts on being a homemaker. This shift gave her more time to explore new interests and hobbies which include traveling, cake decorating, crafting, and home renovations. Much to her surprise, she discovered, almost by chance, that she also loved to write. Hoping to encourage her own children to embrace reading, Cinnamon started writing stories that she thought would cater to their preferences. She focused on plots that centered around characters her children admired. Although she was informed by her children that her stories were, “good but contained too many words,” Cinnamon found an audience for her work after posting the stories on the internet. Soon, Cinnamon decided to shift her focus to writing stories based on some of her own favorite characters. For now, these include Jane Austin’s most beloved characters."," This Upstairs, Downstairs version of P&P has elements of canon, but it also has a story of mysterious murders alongside of it. The two stories are better woven together towards the end, but at first, the characters have a minimal connection. The author introduces new characters, just to make them victims. I also had trouble with the villain, as his supposed motive for the murders never actually presents itself. It just felt awkward and made the story disjointed. Darcy’s entrepreneurial endeavors were an interesting difference, but it seems to me that if he wants Lizzy to think well of him it wouldn’t hurt his pride to share something like this with her to make himself appear less haughty. All in all, I felt the two stories got in the way of each other and didn’t do much to make the other a better plot.  I just didn’t like the book very well. "," (Austenesque pick it for me July challenge)A variation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice keeping the timeline of canon. The author spares the reader of any rehash which I appreciate but it would be an advantage to have read PnP prior to this book, albeit strictly not an absolute must.During the story a murder mystery unfolds, this felt more like a sidetrack to the development of the relationship between ODC. Filled out with new events and some added behind the scenes. Written in multiple POV's which scared me witless at the first sentence in chapter 1...An entertaining story with some farce like qualities that take more serious turns in between.I would have liked a faster pace and less reflection/more dialogue and action.Worthwhile.Rated: Chaste "," It's a story with a horrible series of tragic events in the background. Young women who are abducted by an unknown person who accidentally killed one.  The fact that while these girls had been abducted from Netherfield, Caroline ignores it, forgets to give money to the families and generally is the complete opposite of what Darcy would expect from any woman who was the mistress of his properties. Sad that she couldn't even fake compassion or empathy.  The story somewhat follows the original but it's blunted a tad with the new events and characters. It's actually quite good because we don't get bogged down with pages and pages of angst.The humor comes out at times. Darcy needs a new Vicar and Richard finds him one who can start soon. In the meantime he "" borrows"" our favorite toad-eater for a few weeks but doesn't tell Darcy! Oh my goodness.  I enjoyed imagining Darcy thinking he's stuck with Collins.Well worth the effort to read this story. I enjoyed everything except for the abductions. "," I reads tons of Pride & Prejudice variation books and I enjoy them all, including this one.  Great story line!  My comment is a generic one.  Why aren't the authors writing and publishing these books having them edited for mistakes prior to publishing?  They all seem to have lots of mistakes but this particular book gets 1st prize.  It is absolutely full of all kinds of mistakes.  The author acknowledges an editor but I have to wonder what editor would allow a book to be published in this state?  Or are we simply meant to accept that books are no longer held to the same standards we were once used to?Of the 59 P&P books by 19 different authors I've read in the past two years, all have had numerous typos and mistakes in them.  This should not be acceptable. "," I was impressed with the overall plot, tone and vocabulary, but there were so many grammatical, punctuation and even spelling errors, that it was distracting.  I guess there is no such thing as proofreading any more? However, it was an entertaining read. "," I love a story with a sense of humor, and this one has it in spades. There are many different story lines going on, but they all connect beautifully. New characters are introduced, as well as the familiar P&P ones,  and I can't think of any that were superfluous. The action moves along at a nice pace. Not a lot of unnecessary text or repetition, as in so many of these variations.The main difference here was the Upstairs Downstairs kind of theme. Really fun and interesting since the characters were people you care about. The story line is basically the same as P&P, but so much more, and a lot of interaction between the Upstairs and the downstairs.I should remove half a star from my review for the number of errors, both in spelling and context, but I enjoyed the book too much to do that. Someone needs to do a better job of editing next time, and I hope there will be a next time. I would love to read this author again. "," The books are in serious need of an editor.  The first two books were not so bad, misused words, or missing ones. But the third book seemed to be rushed.  The last third of the book, the time frames jumped all over the place.  There was a lack of the romantic feelings of Darcy and Elizabeth. The tenses in sentences did not agree, and words were missing or the wrong ones used so that the story got muddled.  If the author doesn't have access to an editor, she should read the book out loud to catch her mistakes. "," With murders happening around town, I didn’t experience the fear vividly enough that I thought everyone would have in a small town with no infrastructure to deal having a murderer lose among them.I really enjoyed the ending. The ending is almost exactly the same as the ending in the original P&P but from Darcy’s point of view. That was fun. "

Read more","Discover more of the author’s books, see similar authors, read author blogs and more"," This book is preposterous from first to last.  There are so many ludicrous elements that I cannot willingly suspend disbelief. The problems begin immediately. In no universe would Darcy leave a letter to a woman in the hands of a maid at Rosings. If Darcy were ever stupid enough to do this, I can guarantee that LCdB would come into possession of the letter and proceed to make Elizabeth and Darcy’s lives miserable. Yet we never hear of the letter again, and LCdB is radio silent.Back in Meryton, Darcy would never go to an assembly all alone, yet he does. Then, Darcy and Elizabeth are shocked! shocked that she faces ruin after their run in.Jane later sticks her head in the sand about Bingley for pages and pages, when a simple conversation would have resolved things.One of the worst kidnappings I’ve ever read follows. Darcy and Lizzy are Dumb and Dumber, unable to put 2+2+2 together. The villains are obvious and go unpunished for no discernible reason.The little details grate, too.  Darcy visits a mortician; the term didn’t exist until 1895. Caroline Bingley, despite her autumn at Netherfield, never met Sir William? Why would you change such an insignificant plot point?The book also needs an editor.“He knew Elizabeth was wildly traveled.”“I do find you are quite correct. I’ve never experience Mr. Darcy to possess a great amount of patience.” “Especially not when it came to marriage,” Georgiana chuckled.The book has a really…weird thing about callouses. At one point, “The sensation of the callous-covered palm of his hand on her soft cheek sent vibrations up and down her body.” Later, “‘Elizabeth,’” he said quietly as he cupped her face with his right hand. The rough calluses on his palm felt strangely soothing on her smooth skin.”Two-dimensional and illogical all the way through.I can’t even.KU read "," In this story, not only had Wickham poisoned Elizabeth against Darcy but he is also involved in a scheme to kidnap and ruin someone they love. Thankfully, Elizabeth comes to learn the truth about Wickham and with Darcy’s help, thwarts his plans to hurt those they love.This is a very good book as most of what Juliana has written is. I look forward to reading more of her P&P variations in the future. "," He started  with an awful proposal. She  counters  with a harsh refusal .  He's determined to defend himself  against the falsehoods of George  Wickham.  She's determined not to allow him to do so, now what? This time we see the true nature and manipulations  of Miss Caroline Bingley as well as her sister and brother- in- law and this time  they have hired help.  You'll enjoy this wonderful story as Mr. Bingley  gets a backbone.  You won't want to miss it.  Enjoy! "," First of all. A Bingley redemption / builds a backbone story! For those who like that. You’ll love this story. It’s clean too. It’s also creative as the typically villains. You know Wickham and Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine of those who are present they come up with fresh schemes. There’s a few grammar and spelling errors but nothing that stands out majorly. The story is a quick story you can read in a few hours and enjoy. The characters (all who are important anyways) all grow. Though there’s a few loose plot holes they’re rather minor. I think I’d give this story normally a 4 star but Bingley is so awesome I have to give it a 5 star. "," The technical aspects of the writing in this book were good, but I can’t escape the feeling that the author doesn’t quite grasp the characters and the time period. Lots of little things didn’t quite strike true, like Mr Darcy leaving the letter with a maid he doesn’t know, and not being Very Concerned that he never finds out what happened to it. Also, at one point Lydia is described as “ratchet”, which yanked me right out of the story and back to the present.Ultimately, this felt more like decently written fan fiction, more than a novel "," A forced marriage or a ruined reputation are the beginning of this variation inspired by author Jane Austen’s classic novel Pride and Prejudice by Juliana Abbott. I enjoyed it. "," The story wants to be interesting but the development was underwhelming. Lizzy is extremely rude and resembles Lydia more in the first half. Darcy seemed to stay the most consistent.Why do authors feel it necessary to make the negative characters like Miss Bingley and Wickham so evil?Now all the way to the last chapter Lizzy was calling her husband Mr. Darcy. Really? The constant use of the word ""faith"" as an exclamation was annoying. Where did the letter referred to many times go to? When Lizzy and Darcy stood outside the cabin talking by conjecture the occupants should have been able to hear them because they could hear the conversation of the occupants.Of course Jane being held alone in a room with a window and free to move about makes me ask why didn't she open  said window or break it?No I do not recommend this book. "," which I like, with strong connections to canon. I suspect you can sense the upcoming qualification: However, the proofing is sloppy, which was irritating enough to me to result in a lower rating.Most of errors could have been caught by the careful reading of a fresh reader, not one already familiar with the work. It's too easy to substitute what we expect to see with what's actually on the page. "

Elizabeth has survived an arsenic poisoning credited to Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The lady is now a resident of Bethlem. Mr. Darcy's efforts to get Elizabeth the best medical care is credited with saving her life and they are embarking on their marriage as the story begins.The beginning deals more with the wedding night and a misunderstanding as Darcy does not visit Elizabeth and she frets that she has done something to cool his ardor.

And although ""3-stars"" means ""I liked it"" I cannot highly recommend it to others. You may want to read it just to ""solve"" the mystery of who and why murders were attempted. "," This continuation was well done with respect to the first book in the series, and it was interesting in the thread that it chose. Bella went off in a twist of her own, which is, for me in particular, always a pleasure. I do not read variations and vagaries to have the same story as done in The Novel, I want the author to give me something unexpected. This was certainly done, and in a unique spin for a couple of her characters, though most stay very true to canon. Enjoyable read. "," I never finished reading this on the fan fiction site while the work was being developed and am pleased to be able to read it in its entirety. ( I am "" mangosmum"" ).I'm impressed with the planning behind this newest poisoning. The two poisoners are definitely sneaky in managing to add arsenic in the middle of a dinner! The audacity is truly worth a Lady Catherine! Sorry but can't give away the identity of these evil creatures.The conclusion is better than could be hoped for since the rich nobility didn't get punished as the  lower classes do.  The writing is solid and the addition of fun elements were enjoyable. Who knew cows and ghosts could add so much to a tale.I liked it, I really liked it! "," I liked this one much better than Book 1.  I especially liked the story arc around ‘cows’, which is just laugh-out-loud funny every time it’s inserted into the story. "," I did not enjoy this book.  I considered quitting on several occasions.  I did not like the tone in which it read.  Elizabeth had no brains.  Darcy went be every name he owns.  In one conversation Elizabeth would call him all of his names. So frustrating.  Just pick one!!! The story was predictable. It was just a very simple book.  Oh the tone of the story!!!! "," An interesting variation inspired by author Jane Austen’s classic Pride and Prejudice by Bella Bremen. This sequel was quite enjoyable "," I like a love story but a story about attempted murder, no so much.  For Darcy to be so helpless did not make for a good read and there was just so much nastiness in this story that I would rather have not read it.  Anne is the nut case that seems to think it is okay to murder people but I guess her mother was the same. "," This is the second book by this new author that I have read.

Read more","Discover more of the author’s books, see similar authors, read author blogs and more"," This book is, genuinely, one of the best JAFF works I have yet read. The author is extremely talented in crafting a complicated plot with realistic, dynamic characters. The writing style itself is impeccable and flows smoothly with few discernable flaws (I saw one typo and two instances where something should have been italicized, that's it). I hadn't even read the chapters before I'd decided to purchase a copy rather than reading it for free via Kindle Unlimited (which you can, btw). Since it's technically two books in one, $8.95 was a bargain anyway.In short, the circumstances of the original P&P have been drastically altered, yet some of the framework and characters remain in tact. The story opens with a near-death Mr Bennet admitting to his sister, Mr Bingley's stepmother, that he had married and subsequently abandoned a wife more than twenty years ago. An unacknowledged child was the result of the union who, of course, turns out to be Elizabeth. Her mother was then forced to work as a harlot so that she and her children (Jane was the result of a different illicit affair) wouldn't starve, placing them all lower on the social scale than most tradesmen, much less the Gentry class to which they deservedly belonged. They lived in Ramsgate, which is where Mr Darcy, as a favor to his friend's stepmother (who is much kindlier and responsible than her brother), goes looking for what he assumes is an 8yo child... only to find the exquisite, if somewhat rough, 21yo Elizabeth. Then, of course, they both become embroiled in Georgiana's elopement...I particularly liked how the author repurposed the various Bennet sisters, none of whom existed as children of either Mr or Mrs Bennet. Not only did they show up elsewhere, but they were combined with other characters. Lydia Younge is, perhaps, an obvious meld, yet it worked well for all the obvious reasons plus it was interesting to see, on some level, both elopements from the Austen original take place simultaneously. More surprising and clever, however, was the mixture of Mary and Mrs Reynolds, which served the dual purpose of including the former and fleshing out the latter into a more important/active character. Poor Kitty drew the Short straw and was mentioned in passing as an actual cat. Jane was essentially as she ever is, yet poor Bingley was too late.The best part of the book, however, is the characterizations of Elizabeth and Darcy. Despite the change in circumstances (and Darcy has a family scandal, too), they're still recognizable as themselves, if a little more eager to fall in love with one another than in the original. It makes sense, however, considering that Lizzy is more used to general scorn than her Austen incarnation and, thus, not so personally offended when insulted by Darcy at their first meeting. It's amazing how much of Elizabeth's prejudice keeps them apart, when you think about it. But I digress... point is, I loved this Elizabeth and Darcy and was invested in their HEA. They neither fight constantly nor get along too easily and their problems are realistic to many couples. The only thing I found rather odd is that they met and decided to marry in a week, with a botched proposal in between. It didn't feel rushed as I read it, but when they both point out the length of time that has passed, I found it strange that they could love one another so quickly. Of course, they realized the same thing, so it was nice to have that anomaly acknowledged. Either way, their love felt real to me.On that note, I liked how they disagreed with one another. Strange, I know, but sometimes an author's skill is best perceived in how they have their characters interact in strife. Elizabeth and Darcy were equally happy and exasperated together, but each time the latter happened they dealt with their issues in realistic ways. They were not entirely sensible and sometimes required a cooling off period to realize such, but ultimately worked together to mend their relationship when needed. Moreover, they were BOTH usually wrong in some way rather than one being entirely awful and the other a victim; their marriage was an exercise in compromise. Successful marriages work this way, with much sacrifice on both sides so that each can get what they want/need in some amount. Again, realistic portrayal.The content of this work is overall clean, yet not prudish; there is significant sexual attraction between ODC and Mrs Bennet as a harlot obviously brings up mature themes, but nothing is explicit. It finds a happy medium between ""puritanical"" and ""raunchy"" that I believe most readers can live with.I very much look forward to ""Tempt Me,"" the book advertised at the end of this one as coming out in autumn 2020 featuring Darcy as a vampire. I will definitely buy it as soon as it's released and anything else this author puts out. Excellent novel that every JAFF lover should read. "," Well written and t chuckled all the way through. Would have enjoyed it more if it had not been labeled a pride and prejudice variation. The only thing that was related to said story were the names otherwise it was so left field as to be comical. Worth the read though, if you can stop thinking p&p.😁 "," *potential spoilers, be warned*This was a very engaging, very alternate universe take on P&P.  Few characters are who or how you expect them to be (many others are missing as the story does not spend much time in Meryton) with mostly very good results. The two part book goes in very different directions from one to the other, the first mostly about Lizzy's alternate beginnings, encountering Darcy then finding and saving Georgiana from a disastrous elopement. This part reads like an adventure story with all the good and bad guys, suspense, clever escapes and daring heroics which wrapped up rather neatly and a little anticlimacticly.Part two proceeds with marriage, life at Pemberly and Lizzy dealing with how to become the grand mistress and also the great artist she dreams to be.There are new/ different characters introduced throughout and ample depth to the backstory however that's where things somewhat faltered in my opinion.While the book is long and interesting through the end it almost feels it ended too abruptly without the attention to depth to end or at least hint at the directions of the various characters' plotlines that was used to create their backstories. Some of the minor characters just fade away after much build up to explain their being there leaving some confusion and incompleteness at the inconsistencies.Perhaps as a fan of epilogues it felt incomplete as this story had none but in the face of the very changed circumstances of the well known characters, their fates are too vague and the direction of their paths too inconsistent to even imagine a satisfying end.Not sure why this getting so many 5 star reviews, with reservations I gave 4 stars more for the creativity and novelty of the story in a sub- genre filled with so many alternate plot lines that you'd think there can't be anything new but this one is different enough though the character development not as flushed out throughout as I would have preferred. The grammar, editing and writing is well tended and imaginative, unlike a lot of quickly mass produced JAFF available.

I’m always happy to see some heat in my PRIDE AND PREJUDICE variations, and I really liked the character of Bingley; he was excellent to the Bennets. But I did feel the last act of the book dampened the story. After truly getting closer to Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth seemed too quick to doubt him again.

The Elliotts from Persuasion visit the Longs and the Lucases of P&P during the same timeline as the beginning of P&P, for the Meryton assembly, the evening party at Lucas Lodge, the Netherfield ball, and other events. Wickham sets his sights on Mary Elliott, Darcy is fighting his strong attraction to Elizabeth, but failing completely, Bingley is taken with Jane, and Charlotte Lucas is falling in love with Charles Musgrove, in spite of the fact that she's already engaged to Mr Collins. Elizabeth decides to get involved with matchmaking for Jane and Charlotte, which is the ""strategy"" part of the title. The ""starch"" refers, of course, to Darcy.Corrie Barrett is a talented writer, and I much appreciated her clever and humorous banter in this one, particularly between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth, especially, is a sarcastic jokester in this story, and it's highly amusing. Starchy Darcy is put in his place handily by our clever Elizabeth, but he's no slouch himself, and gives as good as he takes. It's this that begins to melt Elizabeth's heart gradually, when he meets her on the verbal battlefield. It's a lot of fun.I deducted a star because the denouement, namely the point at which Darcy and Elizabeth get engaged, lacked chemistry and romance. It seemed like a spur of the moment decision for Darcy to propose, and her answer seemed to say ""Why not? I may as well marry him."" rather than a decision based on passionate love. They both apparently like each other, but not more than that.However, the book is well written and well edited. I recommend it as a pleasant and fun way to pass some time. "," Interesting P&P variation with a mashup of characters from Persuasion marking a rather fun storyline. Pleasant that Mr Collins was unexpectedly not rewarded with a marriage to Charlotte Lucas and Wickham had a new target. Caroline Bingley is still vain, although the Elliot's do give her a run for her money. Enjoy. "," Brava! This is a rare book where everything was perfect. Humor and wit with a decent bit of drama, but not too much angst. I loved the writing style and characterizations.  This is going to be a read aloud with my 5 daughters. 😁 And I'll be purchasing it for my library.  Mary and Whickam was inspired. 😆I can't wait for book 2!

Ms. Garrett takes us on a merry dance as she introduces us to new characters and updates us on old friends. Must read with a tongue in cheek.  Well not exactly new people as they are from another story. "," I Am still smiling and have smiled my way through most of this book.  It is so very well written as the personalities, strengths and weaknesses of each novel is set off against the characters of the other.

It is something to think on and gives her a perilous distinction among her companions. Elizabeth Bennet, Dragon Keeper, accidental guardian of Pemberley the young firedrake, and even more accidentally betrothed of one Fitzwilliam Darcy, would beg to disagree. Banished from her home, her marriage indefinitely delayed, and desperate to secure Pemberley’s future, Elizabeth must tame a rogue dragon who is determined that she is the last Dragon Keeper in the world whom he would ever accept.Darcy cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which upended every expectation he had for his future. That is not to say this particular future with Elizabeth is unwelcome. But he never expected for that future to be stayed whilst he was called so very far away from her, caught in the middle of keeping the fragile peace between dragons and humans.

As soon as I accepted that this series was a Pride & Prejudice variation mostly in name only, I enjoyed it so much more.  While it’s fun to see an imagining of what Lizzie and Darcy would be like as a couple, many of the characters are far off their characterization from the original P&P.  (Most disturbing is Mr. Bennet, who in this version is domineering and mean to his favorite daughter.)  It’s an intriguing world of dragons and the people who can understand them, set during the Regency time period.  It would have worked better if it was just that, rather than adding P&P names to characters who don’t resemble their namesakes from the original.  It was good to see the character development in both Lizzie and Darcy, which does hearken back to P&P.  Many questions that seemed like plot holes in the first book were answered.  The world-building was extensive and is enough to keep me interested in further books in the series. "," The combination of old and new story telling merges wonderfully in this 3rd story of dragons and Jane Austin characters. "," WOW! Just...WOW!The last time I felt this way was after finishing the seventh book in the Harry Potter series. Ms. Grace's trilogy has that same ability to transport the reader into a fantasy world and make it feel very, very real.If you're looking for a lot of romance, it's likely you'll be disappointed. Don't worry-- Darcy and Elizabeth are still front and center. They're now betrothed to each other, but Darcy hasn't been able to express his feelings to her, despite Walker's insistence that he should do so. A major disagreement arises that makes Elizabeth question whether she can go through with marrying him. They do enjoy a fair amount of kissing. However, their love story takes a back seat to all the dramatic adventure and mystery the two are caught up in, surrounded as they are by dragons and intrigue.Virtually all the characters (including those of the dragon variety) from the previous two books return. Colonel Fitzwilliam and Darcy start off on the route toward Gretna Green in search of Wickham and Lydia. Elizabeth is at Netherfield, supposedly preparing the estate as a wedding surprise for Jane and Mr. Bingley while they're off on their honeymoon. But what she's really doing is searching for maps and clues to help locate the rogue dragon that seems to be in the area. Longbourn is still off-limits, with both her father and the estate dragon furious at her, mostly because of her refusal to marry Mr. Collins. Mary is betrothed to Mr. Collins instead, as decreed by the Blue Order, and their wedding takes place. Unfortunately, Mr. Collins still doesn't grasp how important it is that he learn to get along with dragons, since he still thinks of them as merely animals without recognizing their intellect.Meanwhile, an envoy representing the Eastern Dragon Federation is en route to meet with England's Blue Order. The news quickly spreads throughout the country about a possible rogue dragon on the loose, creating tension among all members of the Order. Leaders of the Order in London become concerned that the envoy could be mistaken for the feared rogue and attacked, which would inevitably lead to all-out dragon war.SO much develops from these plotlines, which build and build and build before they finally converge. We learn some dragons can read and write. Elizabeth is able to exchange messages with the hidden dragon, with discouraging results. The Order sends Fitzwilliam on what could be a suicide mission. Dragons mate and lay eggs, and we witness dragon chicks hatching, imprinting on new Keepers, which have surprising effects on attitudes and subsequent events. Another Bennet sister disappears and is searched for. Two major dragons get into a fight for dominance. There's a battle between a human and a dragon. A Dragon Conclave is called to determine the fates of a Keeper and a dragon, along with other Order business. Whew! What a wild ride!I know I mentioned this in my review for one of the previous books, but the characterizations of the dragons are just incredibly vivid. Not only is this true for each dragon species, but each individual dragon is different from the others, as well. April (Elizabeth's dragon companion) has a personality quite unlike Heather and Phoenix even though they're all fairy dragons, for example.The writing immerses the reader completely. Now that I've finished, I can think of a number of Recency rules that are stomped on, mostly of the lack-of-proper-chaperoning variety. I didn't care a whit as I was reading because I just needed to know what would happen next. And with all these dragons and conversations about dragons going on, you'd think there'd be more dragon-deaf witnesses (servants? family members? travelers? hunters?) getting caught in the middle besides Mr. Collins, but they're as absent and/or clueless as Muggles in a world full of wizards. Just as wizards have their spells, dragons have their ""persuasion"" to keep their presence a big secret.I was a little disappointed near the end at Elizabeth's comparison of events to her ""fairy stories,"" which had its usual negative effect of jolting me out of full immersion in the book. Considering the overall excellence of the rest, though, I have to forgive the author.I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could! "," This is an awesome read. The body of the story carried you smoothly from one astonishing event to the next. It showed the magic of dragons, love and love of family; whether human or animal or dragon. "," This is,once again, a most enjoyable next installment in the Dragon sagas. There is humor, drama and characters to make one hope the story didn’t end. But since it did, I am looking forward to the next one. "," Fans of P&P should know that only Elizabeth, Darcy, and the Gardiners come off well in this series. All the other canon characters, including the rest of the Bennets, are dislikable. One of the worst is Mr. Bennet, so consider yourself forewarned.This is Book 3 of the four-book series that brings a dragon-centric culture to the characters of “Pride and Prejudice”. Ms. Grace also has begun a subsequent series set in the same dragon world but using the characters from “Persuasion”.The author has done a wonderful job of creating an England where dragons – both major and minor types – have lived in relative peace with humans for several hundred years. This agreement was forged between the King of dragons and the human King Uther Pendragon after a series of devastating wars between the two sides.Not all humans can speak to dragons. Those who can do so, are initiated into the Blue Order, which regulates both humans and dragons. The agreement requires major dragons to partner with a human, called a Keeper. The dragon’s territory is the Keeper’s estate boundaries.Humans who can hear and speak to dragons but have no landed estate, can bond with a minor dragon of any variety, and are called Dragon Mates. Minor dragons are able to “suggest” to ordinary humans that what they’re seeing is an ordinary animal – a chicken, perhaps, or a hummingbird or domestic cat.But a major dragon is what it is – an apex predator, huge and terrifying. They hide from ordinary people, keeping company only with those humans who can talk to them. Strict Blue Order rules bind the interactions of dragons and humans, with severe penalties for those who violate the rules.Bk 3 brings us deeper into the world of dragons and what role the Blue Order plays. Elizabeth and Darcy are still separated by duty, betrothed and missing one another. Elizabeth is trying to find and talk to the rogue dragon, while Darcy and his cousin Richard (Colonel Fitzwilliam) are searching everywhere else to find Lydia and the villainous Wickham.If you enjoyed the action/adventure in Bk 2, there are even more here. Several clever plot twists add to the suspense, with Elizabeth continuing to learn even more about the intricacies of dragon culture that were unknown before. Once again she shows how her unconventional approach can solve problems that stymie both men and dragons, putting her in a unique position that flummoxes even the Blue Order.A wonderful finale to the plot! Bk 4 adds depth to the background of our heroine that fans of this series will enjoy.Buy all four books, and binge-read over a weekend when you won’t be interrupted. Highly recommended for fans of P&P and any kind of dragon! "

I had a hard time getting into it and kept putting it down. There were aspects which I greatly appreciated and others which left me shaking my head. I think I'm going to do this in a pros vs cons list.Pros:*Very little annoying Mrs Bennet cuz she dies early on in the book. Not a spoiler; that's mentioned in the description. Becuz of this, Jane and Elizabeth step up as mistresses of the estate and ""mothers"" to their younger siblings. As a result, all the Bennet daughters are much better behaved.*A Bennet son means no/very little Mr Collins. Yay! He does show up eventually but only for a few pages.*Darcy very quickly sees the error of his arrogant ways and takes steps to become a better person.* **spoiler** Jane is astute enough to see right off the bat that Bingley is not the man for her.* Wickham is dealt with satisfactorily, though I was disappointed in his character. More on this later.*Loved Louisa Hurst and her having found a backbone and the mettle to stand up to Caroline.*Loved that Mr Bennet finds happiness.Cons:*First and foremost, so many distracting editing errors. At one point, there was even an editing note in parenthesis left in the text. Obviously, based on what the note said, it was heeded to, but the note was not deleted. Mostly it was misspelled/incorrect words, but a lot of them. One I can think of referred to the chamber being lit by so many ""castles."" Christman instead of Christmas, wrong names being used in taglines, etc. Along these same lines, it drives me batsh!t when JAFF authors mistake titles in the peerage system. Miss Bingley becomes engaged to a man who is to inherit a baroncy...he is not a Lord! Only viscounts and above are referred to as Lord. If he has no title of his own yet, he would be simply Mr. If he holds a lesser, honorary title (knight or baronet) he would be, at the most, Sir FirstName.*Very lacking in romance. Darcy doesn't even show an interest in Elizabeth until AFTER the main conflict. They quickly become friends, talk a lot, are often in one another's company, but there is no longing for her, being mesmerized by her beautiful eyes, wishing he could pursue her but lamenting her poor situation. When he finally does noticed her in more than a platonic manner, what does he do? He leaves. He goes to Pemberley and goes about his business. When he finally does decide that he can't live without her (with very little instigation), we don't really get to see his attempts at wooing her, despite Col. Fitzwilliam's telling him that's what he needs to do. It's just a sentence or two about them spending time together and then he proposes. Extremely dissatisfying. This did not feel like a story about ODC, but the Bennet family and how they fared after the death of their mother. For goodness sakes, Mr Bennet got a more satisfying romantic arc than Darcy and Elizabeth!*Mr Wickham's character was ridiculous. He wasn't this cunning, conniving, manipulative eel who charms everyone around him. He's kind of a bumbling idiot who just wants to drink and seduce servant girls. If it weren't for the assistance of Captain Williamson, I felt that Wickham would have been no threat at all.*Conflict fell rather flat. Wickham and Williamson are cheating at cards. Ok, but it never really does that much damaged. From the story description, I thought Luke would get pulled in and waylaid under heavy debt and have to hide his habit from his family creating so much drama and angst. Nope. He plays once then never goes back. End of story. even the gentlemen who continue don't lose out *that much*. Sure, twenty pounds was a lot back then, but even Sir William is relieved his son owed such a small amount. Then Wickham seeks his revenge but is quickly forestalled then dealt with rather quickly. At no point was I hanging onto my reader worrying about the outcome. All the good guys had the situation well in hand.*The description on Amazon made far too much of what very little conflict there was. ""Elizabeth is forced to help run the Bennet household and raise her younger siblings."" Not really. A lot of emphasis was placed on Jane taking on that duty. Elizabeth helped but at no point did I feel it was a great burden. ""Gentlemen come calling, but much to Elizabeth's surprise, it's Darcy who steals her heart."" What gentlemen come calling? ""With responsibilities to estates and families, neither imagines such a pairing could work."" The only reference to this is a mention that they might have to wait until Elizabeth's siblings are older. I hate descriptions that are written to draw the reader in but stretch the truth of the matter for enticement's sake.I am not sorry that I read this book; it was lighthearted and very low angst, as Ms Kendig's works tend to be. However, this is probably not one I would read again. I wouldn't advise anyone not to read it, but neither can I give it a hearty recommendation. If you've got nothing better to read at the moment, go for it. "," Being in the mood for a little something different in a P&P variation and also keen to try this new to me author, I picked up Longbourn's Son to see what would happen if two connected, but separate events occurred.  What if Mr. and Mrs. Bennet had a son?  And, what if Mrs. Bennet passed while her youngest children were still little?  It roused my curiosity before I even opened to the first page.So, yes, Luke Bennet is the twin to Kitty and Mr. Bennet is a widower.  Mrs. Bennet's last bout with illness hadn't been imaginary and now Jane and Elizabeth share the running of Longbourn and bringing up of their younger siblings.  Mr. Bennet was appalled that he mistook his wife's last illness, but the majority of the ill-suited marriage and his own indolence kept him from his library and books for long even with a well-run and calmer household.  He is determined, however, to fulfill his wife's deathbed wish to keep Luke safe and sound which leads to friction as a young, active boy resists mollycoddling.The book advances to the point when the original P&P began.  Netherfield Park is leased to Mr. Bingley who brings along his friends, the Darcys.  From there, the changes in the Bennets affect the direction of the book, though yes, Darcy does say those infamous offending words at the Meryton Assembly and, yes, one gets a large dose of Caroline Bingley's snobbery, Wickham's dastardlyness, and Lady Catherine's loud and obnoxious strictures.  Meanwhile, the reader gets treated to an original storyline of the darling Bennets and Darcys through it all.  I do believe I enjoyed this Jane and her relationship and then what came for Charlotte Lucas perhaps most of all, but go Louisa Hurst for standing up to her sister.Without spoilering, this is one that cupid does some shuffling and one ends up with some intriguing romantic relationships.  Never fear, Darcy and Elizabeth remain sacrosanct.This turns out to be a relatively low-angst story when it comes to relationship conflict and the bulk of the conflict comes from without which is actually how I generally prefer it.  A few characters are over the top and there is a generous dollop of sugar as well as inspirational thoughts, but I enjoyed the sweetness of the story including those several epilogues that gave the reader the future after all was said and done.All in all, it was a fabulous outing with a new to me author and I will definitely be picking up more of her Austenesque variations.  Those who enjoy sweet and inspirational historical romance with an emphasis on family should give this a go. "," I am a great enthusiast of Jane Austen & the many Pride & Prejudice variations.This story is a wonderful addition to them. I couldn’t put it down & the story got better and better!!I highly recommend this to everyone who love  the P & P variations. I got lost in the stories so well intertwined in this beautifully written book! "," This story veers off from the very beginning with the birth of the Longbourn heir. This changes everything so don’t expect it to bear much resemblance to the original tale. There are the usual characters with similar qualities that we expect with the exception of Jane, who has taken on the role of homemaker and mother to the family, and Lydia, who has not been indulged by a doting mother and so does not present as flirtatious. That being said the story is very satisfying in how it plays out. There are a slew of unexpected match-ups but nothing earth shaking. In other words ODC find their HEA with each other as per usual. "," The Bennets have a son! Of course, this changes things for them, I liked the impact on the characters and their relationships. That was very well written. Darcy comes to Netherfield at Bingley’s request, but he brings Georgiana too. All the usual characters are present with a few more. I’m still not convinced with Bennet’s second wife, it’s an interesting choice for sure. Darcy and Elizabeth’s relationship is side-lined. On the flip side, there is a lot of content,  three epilogues for goodness sake! Original and fun read "," I liked the way the author changed up the story. Take out Mrs. Bennet, add a son, and everyone’s happy. I loved the way Lizzy laughed at Lady Catherine, and told off Mr. Coolins! I actually cheered! "

Darcy and Elizabeth unexpectedly meet in London, and by accident are seen publicly in a rather scandalous posture. Both their family relations are appalled, and wish to avoid gossip. The solution? Leave town for a while, of course - let the gossip die down.Unfortunately, both of them ending up going to the same place - namely, Kent. Even worse, Lady Catherine hears the gossip that Darcy was seen embracing a hussy in public, and that the fortune-seeking hussy was named Elizabeth Bennet! Breathing fire (figuratively, of course) Lady C descends upon the parsonage, demanding the hussy be tossed out immediately.The writer does an excellent job showing two people falling in love, yet still failing to understand one another. I liked how Jane got the chance to correct Elizabeth's 'obtuseness', as she doesn't receive a lot of screentime, even in canon.Note that Ms. Rachel wrote a very short epilogue to this story, and it is available on her website (not the Amazon author page, but the author's own website).

"," This author is an automatic purchase for me since I've read everything available from her on Kindle, and have never been disappointed. The story begins when Elizabeth, on her way to visit Charlotte Collins in Kent, stays with the Gardiners in London. They go to the theater, where Elizabeth encounters Darcy, and there's an incident that has the potential for scandal involving the two of them. At this point, Elizabeth still has no great opinion of Darcy, and Darcy is finding that he's powerless against his strong attraction to Elizabeth. During the subsequent campaign to avoid scandal, Elizabeth quickly realizes that her first impression of Darcy may have been flawed.I so much appreciate that this author knows how to write humor. The clever and playful banter between many of the main characters is superb, and such fun. This is a swoon worthy Darcy, and an Elizabeth who, fortunately, doesn't fight too long against her growing appreciation of Darcy's good qualities. The Gardiners are wonderful in this version, even more so than usual.The book is well written and well edited. I only wish it was a full length novel because I didn't want the fun to end. I hope this author will create more novel-length stories. I recommend it highly. "," I will say up front, that I had a pre-read of the book from the author, as well as enjoying the suspense of knowing about the idea before she wrote it from a writer’s blog. That said, I still rarely write reviews. I either like a book enough to read it again or I don’t. This one I have read three times already, so I guess that must speak for itself. I loved reading and rereading the way Elizabeth finally figured out that she loved Darcy.I liked the premise of “saving” Mr Darcy from the get-go, making the evolution of the story an opportunity for the author to create a new flavor in JAFF offerings where many stories seem vanilla. It had a nice balance of suspense, foolishness, and romance while using only a few of the usual annoying characters necessary to advance the plot and keep the entirely new storyline moving.The characters were well developed, the dialogue believable and entertaining, and best of all, I didn’t have to edit it in my head as I read it! Thank you. "," An incident at a theatre leaves our couple somewhat compromised when Darcy trips and falls on Elizabeth as they are going down a flight of stairs. We soon discover that he didn't trip accidentally. Someone pushed him, and Elizabeth knows that the someone is our favorite enemy, George Wickham (or as I like to call him, Icky Wicky). Elizabeth, of course, is not too impressed by Darcy. Darcy in turn adores Elizabeth and can barely hide his feelings.As Darcy struggles to heed the stern call of duty while secretly delighted, and Elizabeth struggles to avoid a loveless marriage, we are treated to a series of events that seem to conspire to bring them together.You'll find the sparkling prose and engaging dialogue that have made author Melanie Rachel a ""must buy"" for so many of us. Enjoy! "," Sweet short story. Low angst this author always delivers..You might enjoy this FD and EB, are cute..  Good conversion in the writing "," Another delightful book from this author! I'm sure I will be re-reading it many times. The dialogue is witty and the characters wonderful. I liked this Darcy very much.I especially liked the cleverness of Lady Matlock conspiring with Mrs. Gardiner to mitigate the effects of the gossip, and the way the rest of Darcy's family rallied around him.  His determination to do what he could to help and protect Elizabeth was sweet, and he was so nice to her while he tried to convince her that she should accept his marriage proposal. Lady Catherine was horrible, but I loved the way that Charlotte and Elizabeth stood up to her - go Charlotte!  Wickham got better than he deserved, but he was out of their lives, so things were as they should be.I highly recommend this book! "," I had been anticipating Ms. Rachel's new story, and I started reading as soon as I had the opportunity to. Six hours later (including various tasks), I found myself seated and smiling satisfactorily, having finished the novella and bonus epilogue. Like her other well-written novels, the dialog is quick, witty, and fun. I liked how the misunderstandings of canon were explained without angst. I also enjoyed how fate stepped in each time Darcy tried to deny his attachment to Elizabeth. I would recommend this story to anyone wanting a small escape from the weightier responsibilities of daily life. "," I loved this story.  It has beta read so no plot holes.  Lizzy sounds like Jane Austen's Lizzy and Jane is sweet but strong.  Darcy is not so uptight but considering the circumstances I can see how his behavior would change for the better.  Both of ODC received their needed character change by circumstances rather than words.  Highly recommended. "

I do not know why Jane and Lizzy liked so much to stay in Gracechurch Street, for our aunt is most unfair. She read me an odiously dull lecture, which was so long that I scarce could have been expected to listen attentively, and then this morning dared to tell me that the consequence of ignoring her was quite my own fault.”Mrs. Bennet and her sister are bound for Bath to take the waters. The mistress of Longbourn could not part from her duties if it were not for Mrs. Gardiner of Gracechurch Street. At Elizabeth’s request, her favourite aunt has offered to take up residence for the few months Mrs. Bennet is absent. Mrs. Bennet may doubt that her brother’s wife could manage her family even half so well as she, but as she considers the attractions of Bath, she assures herself that no permanent alterations could possibly be made.Aunt Gardiner hopes otherwise.Mrs. Gardiner Takes a Hand, the seventh Pride and Prejudice variation by Jeannie Peneaux, is an epistolary novel. Letters are sent to the most surprising people and read with varying degrees of alarm and pleasure.  Read more","Jeannie Peneaux is a thirtyish-year-old mother of three and wife of one. Jeannie is an easy sort of person to please and likes reading, writing and cooking-- particularly when the cooking involves cake. A good evening involves chocolate cake and a thick book."," First off, do note this is entirely in epistolary format (i.e., letters from many people, including some new characters). Some people don't care for this type of story, but I would urge them to give this at least a chance. It is a brilliant and very creative P&P story.All Austen fans love the Gardiners. Here, Mrs. Gardiner comes to look after Longbourn while Mrs. Bennet tends to her convalescing sister, Mrs. Phillips, on a trip to Bath. The timing works for everyone, as youngest daughter Meg Gardiner, has been slow to recover from an illness, and her worried parents wish to bring her to the cleaner air of the countryside to regain her health. Meg and Mrs. Gardiner arrive at Longbourn, and everybody is happy to see them.But matters at Longbourn are not quite as Mrs. Gardiner expected, despite previous family visits. Mr. Bennet is far more irritating than she previously experienced. Lydia Bennet is much wilder and heedless than she should be. Mary and Kitty clearly need the kind of gentle encouragement given earlier to Jane and Elizabeth when they were younger.Under Mrs. Gardiner's understated but firm guidance, many things change at Longbourn, even as Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips find themselves in startling company in Bath. Mr. Collins visits, but his selection of a wife is completely unexpected, with the ripple effect spreading much further than anyone could expect. Kitty discovers a remarkable new talent. Mary is found guilty of secretive and scandalous behavior. Lydia's next goal is a meat pie (but don't worry, her subsequent goal manages to surpass one of her sisters, without ever meaning to).I have read many of Ms. Peneaux's stories, but this is the best and wittiest by far. When I read Mr. Bennet's letter to Mrs. Gardiner, I almost fell off my chair, I was laughing so hard! She captures Bennet's wit even better than Austen did – if anyone, it reminded me of the delicious biting humor of Oscar Wilde or Mark Twain.Most e-books I read are deleted right after I review them. I keep <10% of the JAFFs, but this is one of them. In fact, right after I finished it, I went back to the beginning to read it a second time! It was too much fun not to enjoy again, without hesitation.Highly recommended for those who don't mind the letter exchange format, and would enjoy humor and surprise in the Bennets' HEAs. "," 5+  This book was such a treat to read!Mrs. Bennet leaves Longbourn for several months to assist her sister, Mrs. Phillips, who is feeling poorly. They travel to Bath for the healthful sea air and waters - and Mrs. B ends up mingling in local society quite a bit.As it happens, one of the Gardiner children, Meg, has been having difficulty with her lungs. Consequently, Mrs. Gardiner comes to Longbourn with her daughter, both to act as Mistress of the estate in Mrs. Bennet's absence and to nurse Meg back to health away from London's smoky air. She proves herself to be a capable woman who takes charge of her five nieces and indolent brother-by-marriage for the decided benefit of all.Ms. Peneaux tells the story via letters from various senders to various recipients flying in many directions. Mrs. Gardiner frequently writes to her husband back in Cheapside, as does Elizabeth. Elizabeth is also the chief scribe on behalf of all her sisters sending news to their mother in Bath, but a letter Kitty sends is misdirected, leading to one of many surprising plot twists. Mr. Collins and his disapproving sister, Mrs. Shipman, also exchange letters. His choice of wife here seems inspired by JAFF fandom's delight in his infamous love of Longbourn's potatoes! His narrow-minded opinion regarding the proper education of women - which he attests is supported by his bishop - sets up another intriguing pair of correspondents. Once Mr. Darcy arrives, he exchanges letters with Georgiana, providing his perspective on various developments.Meanwhile, events in Bath gain significance, as Lady Catherine has brought Anne there to improve the girl's health in anticipation of her becoming Mrs. Darcy ere long. The grand lady is introduced to Mrs. Bennet. Anne shares her observations as she writes to her cousin Darchy, and Mrs. Bennet tells her family about their encounters in her missives.I can't overstate how well-written this book is. Perfectly edited. The letters are convincingly diverse, allowing the reader to determine the personalities of the various ""authors"" as well as the information necessary to piece together what's happening.And it's a whopping good story - lots of humor, minimal angst, surprising turns. Probably less steambetween Darcy and Elizabeth than we generally read in a conventional variation, but their obsession with each other is apparent in the letters they pen. So isthe affection Mrs. Gardiner has for her husband in her letters to Cheapside.Highly recommend!Content is clean. "

But how is a sprite to work that magic when stubborn mortals Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet keep fighting against their destinies? Well, a sprite will do whatever he must! Even if it means forcing the pair to see the world through the other’s eyes.

"," I couldn't put this book down!  This is the novel you should read this summer! The author created a detailed and believable counter-world of helpful spirits who assist humans who are in need.  Darcy and Lizzy wore out their helper to the extent that he felt he had to try something very unusual - so he had their souls switch places and they inhabited each other's bodies for awhile.  And the story gets even more interesting.  Written from Darcy, Lizzy and Emrys point of view allows us in on the thoughts and actions of all - through three points of view.  I loved that.  I always want to know more... But it was not repetitive - only well crafted giving us glimpses of all.  Mr Collins actually proposes to Darcy (looking like Lizzy) with Lizzy (looking like Darcy) looking on... My favorite small part has to do with a maid, a chamber pot, a bit of magic and Caroline Bingley in a most unattractive dress.  That made me giggle out loud in the middle of the night!  I did want the book to go on longer, though the story was over as far as Emrys part - but it was a world I felt comfortable in and I enjoyed my visit.  I loved this author's work and hope to read more! "," Fates have decided that Elizabeth and Darcy belong together only the pair have no idea what havoc they are causing by denying the fates.  A pesky sprite comes up with a way for the duo to see the other person for who they really are by changing bodies.I am not a fan of this type of story, but I did enjoy it. "," A novel and cute handling of the switching bodies trope. Realized it's not particularly my thing, so take star rating with grain of salt. "," This is such an unexpected idea, and a pleasant and humorous story.  The entire story takes place at the Netherfield ball, where Jane and Bingley,  and Elizabeth and Darcy are being observed by sprites whose job it is to make sure that the humans they are assigned move forward to their proper destinies.  Jane and Bingley are behaving as they should, but Elizabeth and Darcy are not.  For this reason, the sprite assigned to them intervenes in a very drastic way.The chapters alternate between the POV of the sprite (called an Emissary), and a third person POV observing the events at the ball.  This is fortunate since, although the emissary is hilarious and cynical and very entertaining, the really good stuff happens at the ball:  ODC butting heads, having their individual epiphanies, and then eventually finding their way to each other.The romance is lovely, and the only ""villain"" is Mr Collins, and he never stands a chance in these circumstances.  The book is well written and well edited.  I recommend it highly. "," This story takes place during the Netherfield ball.

"," I love the words of Henry David Thoreau: “Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each other’s eyes for an instant?” This is a brilliant short story...very unique, very original, and highly entertaining. With a little magical help...Darcy and Elizabeth got to see the world through the other's eyes -- their horror at realizing they were stuck inside the other person's body was hilarious!!!! Yet, by switching bodies, misunderstandings were resolved quickly;  and each became aware of the other's thoughts and true feelings. I chuckled, I sighed, and smiled as ODC slowly came to understand how they felt about each other. To have Darcy have to endure Collin's horrific proposal, was absolutely hilarious!!!! Collins is dimwitted. Hearing Collins proposal certainly kept Darcy from making the mistake of delivering an insulting proposal to Elizabeth, as he did in Cannon. This is a very cute, engaging book!! Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! I read it cover-to-cover in one sitting!!! I highly recommend this entertaining story!! "

Mr. Darcy receives a visit at his isolated manor in Cornwall. It is Charles Bingley, and he is there to ask for a favor. He needs help with his new estate, Netherfield. As for Miss Elizabeth Bennet, there is nothing she likes more than a laugh – except for a mystery.From the moment she first encounters Mr. Darcy, she senses he is hiding something. But the more she tries to find out about who he is, the more evasive he becomes. However, Elizabeth soon turns her attention to someone else. As Mrs. Bennet points out, Mr. Darcy is a nobody, and Elizabeth needs to marry someone who can provide for her and her sisters.Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy doesn’t want anyone to know about the scandal that haunts him from the past. He certainly doesn’t need someone like Miss Bennet, who asks him questions and tries to slip him up. Fortunately, he is more than equal to the task of putting her off. What he doesn’t expect is that before he knows it, he finds himself longing to tell her the truth.Are Elizabeth and Darcy meant to come together in this variation, or is Elizabeth destined for somebody else?Note: Mysterious Mr. Darcy is not a mystery.

Duels were illegal, and if a duelist died, a charge of murder resulted. Due to the long and almost constant wars with France, Great Britain had no extradition treaty with France until far in the future (1876).Fleeing England after the duel, Darcy joined the British Army on the front lines, probably with the assistance of Earl Matlock and/or Colonel Fitzwilliam. We learn that Richard Fitzwilliam is taking care of Pemberley and Georgiana Darcy, during Darcy's exile. When the story begins he is still convalescing from battle injuries in Cornwall, the most SW point of England. The assumption is that he has been mustered out or resigned, as there is no indication he remains an active soldier.When Bingley convinces him his help is needed with the rental of Netherfield, the stage is set for Darcy and Elizabeth to meet. But Bingley's sudden infatuation with Elizabeth Bennet brings turmoil to everyone, and ends in a despairing Darcy. Feeling he no longer has anything to lose, he decides to finally face his fate. Returning to London, he is imprisoned for murder and will face trial.The weakness here is that there is such a big build-up to why Darcy is incognito and the terrible consequences resulting from his action. Yet the trial itself takes a mere 30 minutes to declare him innocent, as both evidence and character statements are all on Darcy's side. It appears the notoriety of the trial is more damaging than the actual death of his opponent.It's hard to believe that any scandal about Darcy would long survive, even if Georgiana wanted a Season in London, or perhaps Bath (which, per canon, we know that she doesn't). He's a wealthy, handsome, well-connected bachelor. Only the highest sticklers in the ton might snub the Darcys. Certainly if they remained at Pemberley for a year or two, other scandals would arise and eclipse theirs.So in the end, the ""mystery"" ends up as much ado about not much at all. YMMV, but I found this story a little disappointing, after such an intriguing description. "," Our story opens three years later than canon.  Darcy has become a recluse at an estate in Cornwall owned by his Uncle.  Bingley convinces him to visit Netherfield where it is unlikely anyone will recognize him.  We are immediately introduced to the central mystery of the story:  why must Darcy hide his identity?The advance of three years has changed the Bennet family.  Jane has married a barrister and lives in London.  With Jane absent from the Meryton Assembly, who will be Bingley’s angel?  Elizabeth has refused Mr. Collins proposal; her Mother still berates her for it.  The youngest girls have matured somewhat but still can be very foolish.  Fortunately, no militia in sight!Elizabeth accepts the mission of discovering the secret surrounding Mr. Darcy.  She prods; he sidesteps.  Eventually, they begin to enjoy each other.  Darcy knows he is not free to marry; especially he cannot marry Bingley’s angel!  But how serious is Bingley in his pursuit of Elizabeth Bennet?  How serious is Elizabeth about Bingley?  Is she ready to marry someone she likes since she has not found someone she loves?Meditation is a valuable exercise, but eventually you have to open up your eyes and look around. ~ Dan MillmanBoth Darcy and Elizabeth must reflect on their altered positions in life.Darcy must contemplate how different his life is when he is not Mr. Darcy of Pemberley.  All of Meryton believes he is the poor friend who is imposing on the generosity of Mr. Bingley.  Bingley, not Darcy, is pursued by all the mothers with unmarried daughters.  Bingley, not Darcy, is respected as the master of property.Elizabeth is forced to contemplate a marriage for a prudent motive when Mr. Bennet is on his deathbed suffering a serious fever.  Finally, she can understand her mother’s fear of Mr. Collins taking over Longbourn.  She likes Bingley.  If he should propose, would she accept?Clues to the mystery are revealed slowly but not completely until near the end.  I was left with some unresolved questions:How did Darcy get to the Continent after the incident?Why did he return to England?Why would he join the Army when he was an only son?For my money, this is the best yet from Monica Fairview.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys JAFF.Seek in reading and thou shalt find in meditation; knock in prayer and it shall be opened in contemplation. ~ John of the Cross "

And Anne wasn't so sickly and had a personality.  Anne was able to see Collins' truth rather than his first impression.  It was fun to see both of them in a new light. Colonel Fitzwilliam was a fun catalyst in the story line, helping the romance along. So yes, I was really enjoying this story and then, suddenly, it ended.  Ended with a bang.  And a ""What?"" came out of my mouth.  I can only assume that there will be more of a resolve with this bombshell moment in the next book.  And I have so many questions about what will happen in the next one.  It obviously can't follow canon so where will the author take this story?

Author","None","Y","2.99","337,189","2015-12-15","307","4.2","87","Villains Redeemed is a collection of six “Pride and Prejudice” variations, all attempting to show how some of Jane Austen’s most vilified characters could actually be good at heart, or at least redeemed. This collection includes five selections which have been previously released alone and one short bonus story.Mr. Collins’ DeceptionJane Austen tells us that Mr. Collins was a man of 'great humility of manner,' but suppose that isn't true. What if Mr. Collins is a very different person than he appears to be? His false portrayal of himself is all part of “Mr. Collins' Deception.” Originally released on May 3rd, 2015 and is approximately 16,000 words.Caroline and the Footman This variation explores the possibility that Caroline Bingley's behavior is motivated by goals other than a desire to attract Darcy. In an effort to shatter the Caroline Bingley villain motif, this Caroline is not stupid, greedy or villainous, but rather someone with her own life and dreams. Originally released on January 13th, 2015 and is approximately 10,000 words.Lady Catherine Regrets Lady Catherine de Bourgh cannot understand what her nephew, Mr. Darcy, sees in the low born, impertinent Miss Elizabeth Bennet, and with Darcy married, what is to become of her daughter Anne? Lady Catherine’s quest to find her daughter a husband might just lead to a better life not only for Anne, but for herself. Originally released on December 12th, 2015 and is approximately 9,000 words.Mrs. Bennet’s Triumph When Mr. Bennet is killed in an accident, Mr. and Mrs. Collins immediately take possession of Longbourn. While tragic, the death of her husband doesn’t absolve Mrs. Bennet of the now even more pressing responsibility to marry off five daughters. Join her in her struggle and, ultimately, her triumph. Originally released on August 5th, 2014 as a bonus short story at the end of “The Second Mrs. Darcy,” and available on www.renatamcmann.com, this short story is approximately 3,800 words.Mary YoungeIn “Pride and Prejudice” it is difficult to imagine a woman who would both meet Mr. Darcy’s requirements to take charge of Georgiana, and who would trust Mr. Wickham. Though this Mrs. Younge conceals some of her past from Mr. Darcy, she neither conspires with Wickham nor is fooled by him. Originally released on August 27th, 2015 and is approximately 40,000 words.Wickham’s JournalYes, George Wickham is a reprehensible young man, but will he stay that way? “Pride and Prejudice” leaves him in very different circumstances than when he is first introduced. With his whole life before him, will Mr. Wickham ever become an honorable man? Wickham’s Journal can only be found in “Villains Redeemed” and is quite short, approximately 3,900 words.Renata McMann and Summer Hanford began writing Pride and Prejudice Variations together in 2014 and have since become immersed in the amazing world Jane Austen created. Whether you’re a fan of Darcy and Elizabeth specifically or of clean Regency Romance in general, you will enjoy both McMann’s ability to imagine variations of this classic love story and Hanford’s skill in turning these variations of Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet and their enduring love into entertaining stories.  Read more","Renata McMann is the pen name of someone who likes to rewrite public domain works. She is fond of thinking ""What if?"""," Mr. Collins Deception: I read and then reviewed this short story on March 20, 2017.Page 65: Caroline and the Footman: Caro leads a double life: the one we know of in canon and then as a lady in love with a servant, she has to lie and manipulate to get Louisa to allow even one letter a month between Robert and herself. Louisa even goes so far as to fire him. The man bounces back and Caroline has her HEA.Page 104: Lady Catherine Regrets: As a mother, Lady C. begins to search inwardly when she realizes that Anne is helpless to decide anything for herself.Page 136: Mrs. Bennet's Triumph: Now a widow and thrown out of Longbourn, Mrs. B. still looks to marry off her girls...but will her standards for ""husbands"" now be lowered?Page 148: Mary Younge: This longer story among the offerings introduces us to a woman who is struggling to support herself. With the help of a forger she gains the position with Georgiana Darcy. However, she also finds Darcy's attitude when things go awry leaves her desperate. But she has reasons to blame Darcy. Help comes from the oddest acquaintance.Page 290: Wickham's Journal: Wickham is dead. Lydia finds his journal. With anguish she read his true feelings towards her and their marriage, among other thoughts. But a surprise comes to light.These vignettes were imaginative and interesting to read. I enjoyed these different renderings for characters we usually look down on. "," The stories were okay. Mostly ranging around 3-31/2.  The best story which surprised me was Mrs Young’s story.  That was definitely a 5star and maybe more.  Enjoyed that very very much. "," Some good stories but none of them really held true to their canon characterisations which therefore made them somewhat far fetched stories. Generally however, they are in keeping with most of Jane Austen’s thematic villains. Across her novels, her villains are never out and out villains. There is always some human failure, some propensity to weakness, some decision made on poor judgment or on selfishness that make some of her characters seem villainous. But at the end of the day, Austen’s villains are all more or less necessarily human. Some of the stories here though, stretch the comfort of one’s imagination in trying to project some of the characters as essentially good and just, Caroline Bingley and Mr. Collins come to mind. The Mrs Younge story does not equate with Darcy’s idea of being “grievously deceived” by her. Lady Catherine it was quite clear, needed a man in her life and George Wickham’s remorse gave too much credit to Lydia’s sense. But, to paraphrase Elizabeth Bennet “people change so much there’s always something new to observe”. "," This P&P reimagining is a nod to those characters that we may see as villains due to how they are portrayed throughout the story.  They have been given their day in the sun.  Mr. Collins, Caroline Bingley, Lady Catherine deBourgh, Mrs. Younge,  Mr. Wickham and surprisingly Mrs. Bennet.  I was pleasantly diverted reading about the imagined lives of these characters.  It also made me think differently about them.  You will enjoy reading about how and why certain things happened in the story from these characters points of view.  Be prepared for unexpected HEA'S. "," I had read some of these before, and they were just as good the second time around. Kip per cat "," Cleverly written book about rewriting for the villains in Jane Austen's original work of Pride and Prejudice. Characters are well rewritten by the author. In Mr. Collins' Deception, the story is quite funny. Changes one's opinion of the silly man immensely. In Caroline and the Footman, Lousia is the bitchy sister. Caroline wants to help both Elizabeth and Jane find their happiness, but a contract with her sister prohibits this objective. Once the Elizabeth/ Darcy and Bingley/Jane partnership is solid, Caroline petitions her brother and one he gets to learn more about Robert, he gives his permission. With Caroline's dowry, they invest the money into the enterprise where he's working and they become very wealthy by doing so. Unique stories. "," I found all of the stories 5-star worthy except the one on Mrs. younge. For me, that went just dragged on and on.  Worth the price as these 2 authors always write so well. "," This anthology was hard to rate since I liked some of the stories and others I did not care for. I won't go into the plots since they are covered in the description on Amazon. Ms. McMann's books have good, original plots. I recommend this book since I will be reading some of the stories again. It is worth the price of $2.99 "

Fitzwilliam Darcy finds caring for a baby dragon more of a fraught guardianship than anticipated. Little Pemberley may have survived a perilous hatching and still successfully imprinted on humans, but she’s pining for one particular human to the point she is fast becoming a danger to herself and others. Elizabeth Bennet may yearn for baby Pemberley, but she has her own share of misfortunes to manage. Her cousin Mr. Collins, heir to the Longbourn entail, has decided that marrying her will add very greatly to his future happiness. While the estate dragon agrees--and insists she accept him--Elizabeth and the rest of Longboun's dragons insist he is the last man in the world whom she could ever be prevailed on to marry--a better dragon's dinner than a husband.It’s disappointment and spleen all around as Lady Catherine de Bourgh involves herself in the affair after hearing reports of a most alarming nature. There are few people in England besides herself who could make things worse. In that, Lady Catherine is a true proficient.Baby Pemberley’s fate is caught in a deadly tangle of families and fortunes, forcing Darcy and Elizabeth to take the biggest gamble of their lives to win or lose it all.Meryton meets Pern in a fantastical regency romp bound to delight readers of Jane Austen and Anne McCaffrey alike.Book 2 in the Jane Austen's Dragons series.

The world-building and descriptions of the types of dragons is good.  However, this book has taken a major departure from the timeline of Pride & Prejudice.  In addition, many of the characters and relationships are not what they are in the original; they only have names from P&P.  Most bizarre was that Mr. Darcy’s first disastrous proposal to Elizabeth is made in this book instead as a second proposal from Mr. Collins - word for word.  It didn’t make any sense and for a P&P fan, it’s disturbing to see Darcy’s words attributed to Collins.  Despite being a VERY loose P&P variation, it IS a good dragon fantasy story.  The dragon characters are described as well as the human ones.  There are a few minor editing errors but they don’t take away from enjoying the story.  After realizing how much this series was going to veer away from the story and characterization of the original Pride & Prejudice, I had my reservations, but it’s shaping up to be a fun story to read. "," Fans of P&P should know that only Elizabeth, Darcy, and the Gardiners come off well in this series. All the other canon characters, including the rest of the Bennets, are dislikable. One of the worst is Mr. Bennet, so consider yourself forewarned.This is Book 2 of the four-book series that brings a dragon-centric culture to the characters of “Pride and Prejudice”. Ms. Grace also has begun a subsequent series set in the same dragon world but using the characters from “Persuasion”.The author has done a wonderful job of creating an England where dragons – both major and minor types – have lived in relative peace with humans for several hundred years. This agreement was forged between the King of dragons and the human King Uther Pendragon after a series of devastating wars between the two sides.Not all humans can speak to dragons. Those who can do so, are initiated into the Blue Order, which regulates both humans and dragons. The agreement requires major dragons to partner with a human, called a Keeper. The dragon’s territory is the Keeper’s estate boundaries.Humans who can hear and speak to dragons but have no landed estate, can bond with a minor dragon of any variety, and are called Dragon Mates. Minor dragons are able to “suggest” to ordinary humans that what they’re seeing is an ordinary animal – a chicken, perhaps, or a hummingbird or domestic cat.But a major dragon is what it is – an apex predator, huge and terrifying. They hide from ordinary people, keeping company only with those humans who can talk to them. Strict Blue Order rules bind the interactions of dragons and humans, with severe penalties for those who violate the rules.Elizabeth is at Longbourn. She mourns the absence of sweet little Pemberley, as she struggles with a mix of resignation and resentment over how men and dragons rule her life without caring what her desires are. The wyvern Longbourn is grouchier than ever, and her father increasingly in pain, which makes him impatient and autocratic even with his favored second daughter.Darcy is at Rosings, where the dragon Rosings gives some helpful guidance to his little drakling. But Pemberley is inconsolable over leaving Elizabeth. Darcy’s father died before he could fully train Darcy as his replacement Keeper. What Darcy doesn’t want to do is follow Lady Catherine’s advice – least of all about who he should marry, let alone how to take care of a baby firedrake. Her callousness rubs him the wrong way, and terrifies baby Pemberley.When the two finally come together at Rosings, Elizabeth begins to see some good qualities in Darcy. It’s confusing – surely his persecution of Wickham cannot be excused....can it?When the discovery of a rogue major dragon is made, all other problems pale beside it. A rogue dragon is one who has not agreed to the Accord, and could cause another human/dragon war to break out. But where is this dragon? How has it managed to remain undiscovered for so long? Dragons are territorial. How has it not come into conflict with anything before?There is a great deal of action and a fast pace to this story. The romance element is light, but one can see that although Elizabeth remains reluctant, Darcy is now “overflowing with admiration”, as Austen so beautifully put it.Once again, the ending is set so that it answers some questions but others remain for Bk 3 to continue the story.This is a great series and the most creative take on P&P I’ve discovered so far. For those who love ODC and also love dragons, I highly recommend buying all four books and indulging in a very satisfying binge-reading session! "," I finished book 1 yesterday. I enjoyed it greatly. Today I’ve finished Longbourn.  I am happily following the old and new characters as their stories evolve.  A fun read indeed! "," I am so thoroughly captivated by these Dragon stories I find myself rationing chapters. The Dragon and human characters are so well crafted that I feel myself in the story. Elizabeth is the perfect leader and look forward to reading more. "," Such a good series. !! Everybody will enjoy these books. I sure did!!  I loved the love story between the warm ones and dragons "," I wasn't sure if I could make it through this book in the series. The reminder of why I don't care for time periods set in Victorian and Edwardian, became pretty apparent early on in the first book of this series, and definitely in this one.I did end up making the resolution to continue forward, because the main plot was holding my interest, and it did finally reach a point where this became a greater highlight than the time period.So glad I did. Now I was more concerned with the book being over before I was ready. We've all had those. You're looking forward to how it's wrapped up, but saddened to lose what seems like more than just acquaintances, and not just mere fictional characters from a body of writing.I became thoroughly entrenched in reading this one, and although it's a quick, simple read compared to some others out there, I  was deeply rooted in the enjoyment I was receiving from this one, all the way through to the end!The ending is a perfect example as to why I prefer  to begin series after all of them have been released. I'm not very patient when it comes to reading, I don't care for cliff hangers or teasers, so I'm glad there's been 11 released so far. I may not read them back to back, but it's not to know there's still a fair amount to pick up and read forward. "," This is a little more like a romance novel while still good I font think the plot is as good as it’s model "

An exciting mystery, and romance for Lady Catherine.  I would have liked a little more of the mystery , not sure how to explain just a thing or two that could have used a little more detail but plan on buying the paperback for my little collection. "," This book is a bit different than many P& P variations. In fact, there were a number of surprising twists and turns. This book does have Darcy and Elizabeth, but truly focuses more on de Bourgh , and I enjoyed it very much! "," Debbie B.’s review, as usual, sums things up very tidily. This novel focuses on the de Bourgh and Fitzwilliam families, their history and their present romantic and other entanglements. Darcy, more as a cousin to Richard and Anne, plays part here while his love life is on the fringes of this tale. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet do come to an agreement and her father is petitioned successfully – but that is a minor detail here. As an aside, Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennet also find things working out.Anne finds paperwork from her father and asserts herself. Indeed it is she who proposes what will go down as far as future happiness for her but both cousins are on board. Her mother is confronted and offered two choices. Then overnight Lady Catherine is all sugar and spice.This novel spends approximately the first half dealing with the romance events and attachments. While neighbors, the Barrows, have made the intentions that the son will marry Anne fairly clear the mystery about the connections between his family and Lady Catherine’s don’t come to light until the second half of our book. Shockingly we read of attempted murder, realized murder, treason, smuggling, blackmail, compromise and arson. But I have to agree with Debbie in that we never really learn just what the papers to be planted on a certain ship actually contain. Forces are exerted to bend Anne to Mr. Barrows’ will and Colonel Fitzwilliam is considered in the way so he has to be dealt with.We learn just how valuable a faithful and alert servant can be and suffer when this esteemed man is harmed for his loyalty to and his protection of his “family”. Mr. Bingley's uncle, Adrian Cranfield, comes into the narrative and his own story has most ironic links to that of Anne and her mother. Here we are given a reason for Lady Catherine’s bitter and acerbic nature. But it is her transformation that is most profound.I have to share that the story built slowly for me. The romance was sweet but my interest was not truly hooked until the intrigue was at hand and we were told of how it all was engendered from the politics involved in the marriage of Catherine Fitzwilliam and Lewis de Bourgh. Now that was an interesting story! "," The book is very good at explaining some inconsistencies in the original.  Anne shines and Lady Catherine becomes human, rather than a dragon.  ;P "," I think you will find this story interesting and full of not only intrigue, but found love and devotion.  I really like this and believe you will too. Highly recommend this book. "," P & P variation with very little Darcy and Elizabeth. It was well written and entertaining with a touch of mystery. Enjoy. "," It's a good imagining of Anne de Bourgh as frail but not as sickly as her mother Lady C believes. Although it relates the storyline of Our Dear Couple E&D's romance, this really puts Anne as the prominent character. There are villains here, but Lady C is not one of them, for a change.The appeal of a romance between Anne and Col. Fitzwilliam appeals to many fans and authors, including me. Austen gives us nothing of Anne's character or personality, merely her pallid appearance and subdued demeanor. Thus she is a character ripe for JAFF plots, and Ms. Brown takes good advantage of it.Note you will need to accept that Lady C's character changes rather drastically in this story. **SPOILER** Since Austen did not leave the impression that Lady C's care of Anne was directed by maternal concern rather than simple arrogance, Lady's C's change of heart and subsequent HEA ending with Mr. Cranfield may seem abrupt and unrealistic from some viewpoints. "," Leenie Brown has done it again.  With mystery, heartache and much humor…this variation clicks all the boxes.  This s a must read!, "

The Netherfield party has long since abandoned the estate, and Elizabeth is soon to go to Kent to visit her dear friend Charlotte. Walking from her home into Meryton, Elizabeth accidentally eavesdrops on a conversation among Mr. Wickham, Mr. Denny and Captain Carter which shocks her and makes her question her long-held opinion of Mr. Darcy. Consequently, when she encounters Mr. Darcy at Rosings, Elizabeth is more inclined to trust him, especially since she is uncertain what to do about what she's overheard.Meanwhile, the Baroness Darcy, great-aunt of Fitzwilliam and Georgiana, has given her nephew two daunting tasks. At over 80 years old, she is no longer able to host intellectual gatherings of women to promote the creative arts as she did when she was younger. Lady Darcy wants him to revive this Darcy bluestocking tradition. Of course, in order to do that, he must find a bluestocking wife. This feisty old gal is more than a match for Darcy but leaves him a bit confused about exactly what her requirements for his wife are. He's certain that Elizabeth would not be acceptable because of her lack of wealth and connections.There are a lot of very interesting twists and turns to the plot. Mr. Bingley does not come off well here (I seem to be noticing that as a trend among some of my recent JAFF reads!) and proves himself in need of someone to tell him what to do, whether it's Darcy or, in Darcy's absence, Bingley's scheming sister Caroline. Wickham is an even nastier piece of work than usual, despoiling any woman he believes Darcy might have his eyes on. Anne de Bourgh has a secret that's super cool, another that's pretty awful, and a third that affects the very end of the book.In fact, the de Bourghs, Fitzwilliams and Darcys have their share of scandals and secrets, and there's a whopping big one still unknown to most of them. The reader is given lots of teasers for it in the form of letters from A.F. to C. which begin every chapter, but the identity of both the writer and the recipient aren't revealed until near the book's end.Darcy sets the ton on its ear when he attends a number of social events, pointedly avoiding the air-headed debutantes and dancing with those whose female mothers or grandmothers were bluestockings that associated with the Baroness back in the day. He's under even more scrutiny than usual when the Baroness makes it public that he is the heir to the baronetcy.He continues to meet with Elizabeth and the Gardiners regarding handling Wickham. As other reviews have mentioned, the heat between the two is scorching with barely restrained passion. They get a lot of page time together, which JAFF lovers always enjoy.I found myself a little confused at times by both Elizabeth and Darcy. They each seem to mull over the same things over and over, sometimes in contradictory fashion. At times I thought Darcy had already decided to pursue Elizabeth, only to learn from his actions that he was still looking elsewhere despite his attraction to her. Elizabeth supposedly decides she trusts him, then she holds back from telling Darcy all. The two of them just think too much on the pages.Most of all, I had trouble with the whole premise on which the rest of the book is based: Elizabeth doesn't tell her father everything that she knows before leaving for Kent. Yes, she recognizes Mr. Bennet's shortcomings as a parent, but considering the specific details she overhears, I have trouble believing Mr. Bennet wouldn't take it seriously (even though he himself says, at the end, that he probably wouldn't have) and take steps to protect his daughters.While this story comes to a satisfactory conclusion and reads well as a stand-alone, there are open-ended storylines left open regarding Wickham and regarding Anne which will obviously be continued in the next book of this series. I look forward to reading it. "," 3,5 star read that dragged a bit in the first half but had a lot of creative and unique, twist and turns in the second half.It didn't captivate or engage me as much as I would have liked to. I like to be moved but it was interesting.This Elizabeth is not my favourite, she felt somewhat harsh and her accusations a bit repetitive. Darcy was also a bit bland.Entering after Jane has departed for London. Seeking refuge in an ally, Lizzy overhear Wickham making plans to ruin her family. Not taking it seriously, she does not confide in anyone.  Lizzy soon follows Jane to London on her way to Kent and chance upon Darcy at the theatre.In Hunsford it diviate from canon although there was a proposal, it did not follow canon. Darcy does not abandon his suit after her rejection, he persists and receives help from a surprising source. Elizabeth is however not so easily convinced...Back in London, family tragedies seems to come in abundance and old secrets are revealed.Bingley gets his comeuppance as Jane seems to grow a backbone. I really enjoyed seeing Bingley being called out for his fickleness, that does not happen often..All in all a good read. Will be buying the next book, due in 2018 since I am curious of what will happen next... "," Delightful new series opener by Rose Fairbanks.  She never fails to deliver.  I've always thought of Elizabeth Bennet as a bit of a bluestocking, even in the original P&P.  Her father encouraged her to learn and to continue to expand her mind despite her sex.  That is what first drew Darcy in, along with her wit.  My favorite character is Lady Darcy and her story is just classic.  I must admit that my ""Sherlock"" skills were not sharp enough to catch the AF and C of the letters until the reveal.  Anne de Bourge is a special lady in this book as well.  I  like it when she is intelligent and has some strength of character. How she helps Darcy was a very enjoyable surprise. Her story is sad, but many who crossed the path of George Wickham were never the same. The cricket match was such a special treat.  I hope there are more in the books to follow.  I like Jane's new beau and the description of his home.  WOW  This variation has lots of strong characters and intrigue.  Very well laid out.  On to the next book, Rose. "," What a great story! A few shocks, I cannot wait to read book 2 and see what happens. Do not let the title bluestocking scare you off "," This adaptation covers so very much of the typical story and adds in elements of strong women who belong to those Bluestockings. Darcy has an aunt who is reviving the Group and wants him to add smart women to it. Women like Elizabeth who read and have intelligent thoughts about the world around them rather than lace and ribbons.  In this case we see a different side to both Colonel Fitzwilliam and Bingley. Neither come out with honor especially Bingley who has allowed the venom of his sister ruin any relationship he had. He even loses Darcy's support after he gives a direct cut to Jane in public.  Interesting that Wickham becomes more of the degenerate and the list of young women he seduces grows even longer.  My hope is he gets transferred into the Regulars and direct combat.  Great story ! "

"B0C2JRV81X","Wistfully Beautiful : A Pride & Prejudice variation","Elin Eriksen 
Author","None","Y","2.99","55,894","2023-04-13","212","4.1","139","Mr Darcy had not envisaged that as a wealthy, educated gentleman he was considered an underdog. Darcy had promised to teach his friend estate management, but Bingley’s ideas changed so rapidly… He contemplated rescinding his offer when the estate turned out to be a hunting lodge, not even situated on the British Isles. Despite his concerns about the endeavour, Darcy could never have predicted the particular peril he would encounter across the sea, nor such a strong desire to prove his mettle. Miss Elizabeth was clever, witty, and headstrong. But she was blind to the core timber of Mr Darcy, and she had little faith in the revered gentleman. Mr Darcy, who blew into her life—dismissed everything she held dear—rescued her—and left with her heart. Wistfully Beautiful is a low to medium angst, Darcy rescues Elizabeth, Regency era Pride and Prejudice variation of approximately 58,000 words. It is appropriate for an adult audience only due to a steamy wedding night and graphic descriptions of the death of animals.  Read more","Elin Eriksen is a Norwegian author of Austenesque dramas, a proud mother of four children, a grandmother to a beautiful girl and happily married to her own Mr Darcy.    She has exchanged chemical analysis of explosives and pharmaceuticals to stay at home with her children and write chaste and steamy, dramatic stories from the Regency-, Viking- and modern era, taking great liberties with the characters and the plot of Pride and Prejudice.   Elin likes to visualise by making boards of every story on Pinterest under the username: elin.haralsdattFuture releases:2023:Two Components Wistfully Beautiful For The Love of a Highland Thistle Where Love Resides"," n my opinion it was only a matter of time until this Norwegian author set a variation of P&P in her native country.Set mostly in Norway, Elizabeth calls herself a milkmaid. Again she is a great walker but spends time in a shelter for those tending the goats, sheep, etc., according to the season.As the story description says Bingley rents Netherfield which is a Hunting Lodge. They meet their neighbors at Longbourn when the Bennet hold a dance. And again there are misunderstandings between Darcy and Elizabeth. Jane and Bingley seem to have the same fate as in canon as Caroline disdains the community and they all leave abruptly. Darcy does propose but with all the same comments about her family, etc.Darcy has an entanglement with a local bear who is scarred from previous encounters with humans.Lydia's love interest is not as in canon.The author does give us many links to sites which ""picture"" Longbourn, male clothing, etc. as well as a YouTube video of a Norwegian dance and even ""calling the cows"".I don't understand why this name was used ""Virgin Charlotte"" throughout the story.Rated MA as there are fairly graphic descriptions of the wedding night and other encounters. "," I don't know much about Norway or its customs and this story brings in a brief sense of the country and its inhabitants.  Elizabeth lives in Norway where her father owns a huge amount of land and has allowed someone to build a hunting retreat on his land.  Bingley and his entourage have arrived for the salmon fishing, including Miss Darcy and Caroline.While much of the same events occur ( Assembly, dinners, and a Ball) being outside the city we have a bear attack. Darcy and Elizabeth barely survive when an old bear comes near and Darcy eventually kills him which spare the residents of fear from more losses.Of course true love doesn't run smoothly and Darcy and Charles are miserable in London while Elizabeth and Jane are miserable in Norway.  Then Mr Gardiner has to travel to London on business, taking his niece with him!It's an interesting story because of the addition of Norway and its customs which twist it enough to increase interest. "," I enjoyed the story but parts are almost an outline. For example, there is no explanation of how Darcy went from finding Elizabeth lacking in beauty and symmetry to suddenly thinking she is gorgeous. The book needed more of the characters' thoughts. Just generally adding to the story would improve it I think. It must be challenging to decide how much to assume readers already know about the characters and their situations. I most enjoy P&P books that can stand even if the reader is not very familiar with the original. The best parts of Ms. Austen's books are the interactions between characters which enable Elizabeth's witty thoughts and comebacks. "," With my Norwegian ancestry, I particularly enjoyed the experiences of ODC in Norway. The writer captivated the experiences of being in the Norway of the period and drew me into the life of the people.Like Darcy, however, I usually pass on the lutefisk, but never the lefse, which I do not make often enough and never in the super large  circles, as my wonderful grandmother did on flat-topped wood stove. My daughter, granddaughters, and great- granddaughter continue the tradition.Keep writing the P&P variations, Elin, and I expect to enjoy them as much as I have your others. The one will undoubtedly hold a special place in my heart.Thank you!Betty Campbell Madden "," What I liked:- The new setting- Darcy's character- Darcy and Elizabeth were good together.Unsure:- Although Darcy and Elizabeth were good together, I'm not sure when Elizabeth developed feelings for Darcy.- I'm still unsure if the Bennets are wealthy, struggling at the moment or cheap.  They have plenty of land, hidden silver, exquisite gowns for balls, and a prominent family in the area. Mrs. Bennet worries over her last four daughters future if Mr. Bennet dies. Then there is Elizabeth, she's unsure how to address a footman, she wears threadbare clothing and does servant work. It wasn't clear if the Bennets couldn't afford an extra servant to do the work or is that the life they choose to live.Sidenote:Mrs. Bennet started off with a black heart, then her character simply faded into the background. Thank goodness because she was emotionally abusive to Elizabeth. "," Elin Eriksen writes unique Pride and Prejudice variations; this story moves the action to Regency times in Norway. Darcy and Elizabeth, along with most of the characters, stay true to canon.  The bear attack humbles Darcy and begins his epiphany.  The romance is sweet and we learn of many charming Norwegian traditions and folk tales.  I absolutely loved the set down our favorite supercilious sister receives.  Recommended reading for sure! "," How is it possible that Ms Eriksen continues to write such delightful and amazingly unique, special stories that no one else could ever conjure? I love this like all of her stories yet this is in my top 3 favorites of hers!!! Well worth your investment of time and coin to pursue! Thank you! Best, aka JohnnyFlynnFan "," This was a version set primarily in Norway which added some unique coloring to our favorite story’s landscape. The scene mentioning the pig and Miss Bingley will have me laughing for days. While I enjoyed the whole story, it is totally worth picking up just for that! "

You will recognize elements from other stories.  Not to give too much away the story involves an accident, visitation of spirits, comeuppance and a serious readjustment of his thoughts and actions.  So much to undo nevertheless he has choices to make!  These choices will not only impact him others as well.  So read the book to find out if he is up to the challenge. "," This started off quite well, with Darcy smarting from Elizabeth Bennet’s Hunsford rejection. Rather than being humbled, his arrogance and autocracy become worse. He decides Miss Bingley will do for a wife, and tells Georgiana that she will wed his friend Bingley when she is old enough for a come-out.He is anxious to return to Pemberley, and unwisely decides to ride the last leg of the journey. It is the day before the Summer Solstice, celebrated by many as Litha, when the Oak King and the Holly King battle for power.An accident causes him to be marooned in a small, isolated cottage overnight. Darcy’s head aches, but it is not his injury that makes him dream of being visited by three ghostly spirits. One is his father; the others are the Oak King and Holly King.Darcy gets frustrating glimpses of his past, present, and future. His father warns him he has become puffed up with pride, and forgotten the lessons he was given to treat those of lesser station with fairness and kindness. The future he is shown is so dark, it’s nothing short of a nightmare: Georgiana ends up humiliated and friendless, Darcy himself has become a bitter hermit, and Caroline Darcy nee Bingley has wasted the entire Darcy fortune to beggar the Pemberley estate.When Darcy awakens he remembers most – not all – of these three dreams. But were they dreams...or did he actually see what the future would be like for the people he loves, if he doesn’t change his ways?Up to this point it was an engaging and enjoyable story, with good pacing. But then the dialogue became increasingly awkward. Dialogue exchanges, to sound realistic, are briskly paced. People do not speak to one another in long, run-on sentences, as if each person is taking turns lecturing the other.Rather than have active scenes, the author was using these long-winded conversations to inform the reader. It changed the pacing of the story and made it feel leaden. It was more like reading an outline than having the characters “come alive” and interact naturally.Also, it should be noted that although the ending is cute, Charles Dickens was born in February 1812. He would not have been old enough to show any creative aspirations at the time Pride & Prejudice was published.I'd like to see the author rework this with a good editor. I think if she spent a bit more effort on the last third of the story, it would easily push this story up to a 4- or 5-star JAFF. "," This variation borrows elements from Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol.  After a fall, Mr. Darcy is visited by the ghosts of past, present and future, giving him glimpses of his folly and how he suffers a future of unhappiness and misery if he were to follow the path he had decided early on.  Equipped with these visions, Mr. Darcy resolves on a path of personal change, progression and redemption in the hopes of winning the heart and hand of the elusive Elizabeth Bennet.Initially in the story, the characters seem far more severe than Canon, unlikeable even.  For example, it was most uncharacteristic of Elizabeth Bennet to accuse and blame Mr. Darcy for Wickham’s misdeeds with her sister Lydia; while Mr. Darcy’s thoughts and actions were dreadfully cruel and insensitive.  It is noteworthy that this variation is fully in Mr. Darcy’s perspective. This reader would have hoped for Elizabeth’s point of view.There are several typographical errors, the writing seemed hurried, and there are many repetitions of some phrases.However, towards the end, readers can see a reformed Darcy, one who is repentant, kinder, more humble and honorable. The heart-tugging suspenseful moment when Elizabeth reveals her love is so satisfyingly unforgettable.Despite this reader’s misgivings, she still feels this is a good and important read for every Pride and Prejudice fan if only for its connection/reference to Dickens’s timeless classic, A Christmas Carol. "," A fun story and absolutely loved the last line of the book. Admittedly, the story at times is simplistic in its writing and a few typos but overall a fun story with some angst thrown in. There are times when I was younger that I wished I knew what my future held so that some changes could have been made. Am sure all of us have that desire. "," I simply loved it!  Although the book has some heavy going and tackles some controversial issues, it is all done with a light touch and a sly smile.  It’s a fantasy with its feet on the ground, with its head in the clouds, and with it’s tongue firmly in cheek!I really enjoyed how each main character is developed and changes throughout the story.  The last line of the epilogue is priceless.  I highly recommend this book. "," I was not loving it at first. Darcy is decidedly arrogant and seems unredeemable, but then the dreams come and it all gets better and better! Loved it! There was so much more to the story and I did enjoy that quite a bit. Definitely worth reading. "," Darcy is a true ass in the beginning. Talk about hard headed!!! Liked Elizabeth letting him know h e was responsible for Wickham, too!  A HEA  but they have to work for it! "," Highly recommend. A most satisfying read. A reformed Darcy is indeed an awesome Darcy! A different version of a Christmas carol. Totally a P and P version.

This is not one of her better efforts.There is a lot of repetition in some characters' dialogue, most of it quoting or closely paraphrasing original P&P characters. I lost count of how many times Mrs. Bennet called Darcy disagreeable and proud, often more than once in the same paragraph.Some of the narrative is confusing, such as the wedding night scene. The writing is flowery and somewhat descriptive of every move, but they lay next to each other breathless and 'spent' more than once, which fooled into thinking the deed was done -- and then suddenly the deed was indeed fully described at last. I re-read several paragraphs and, yes, it seems to be 'done,' then as if the author forgot E&D were already 'spent,' she starts describing their first time. Confusing.This author has well edited books and has a good command of writing structure, but I think I'll be more cautious in future about paying for her work. Her actual story-telling skills are not as good as I prefer, or at least the quality is not very consistent across her various books. "," In my opinion, whether you like the true blue  to cannon variations of Pride and Prejudice or the spicy more daring versions, this is the best work I have read from Demi Monde or Bella Breen.As it is a spicier version, I love Elizabeth's curiosity about a book she finds in the Netherfield library while staying there to care for Jane, who is ill.She knows that this particular reading material is considered inappropriate for unmarried young women, but she can't resist the taboo material.  When Mr. Darcy enters the library and discovers her secret, he is intrigued.  Yes, in the Regency Era, a gentleman might have exited the library with Elizabeth none the wiser, but this is a variation, and Darcy is only human.This was a cute, romantic, and spicy novella.  I thoroughly enjoyed this fun little book! "," I loved this perfect slow burn. Elizabeth and Darcy, stuck at Netherfield as Jane recovers from her cold. Elizabeth finds some torrid how-to books in the library and sneaks away to read them at all hours, but mostly after the house is asleep. Naturally, Darcy catches her, and they spend most of the rest of the book trying to stay out of the way as the steam builds, overcomes both Mr. Collins and Icky Wicky, and finally comes to a boil. I won't spoil it, but the wedding night is positively not to be missed. This fairly short book will keep you entertained--really entertained--on a rainy afternoon or evening. Don't miss it! I have to add that the author's plotting skills are improving by leaps and bounds, so you'll be kept amused and entertained the whole way through by this fresh approach. "

So far this variation is this reader’s 3rd novella of the author’s work, and latter did not fail to please with this one. The author manages to conjure a “What if” story that many of JAFF P&P fans would think of: what if Fitzwilliam Darcy’s parents are still both living? What effects would that have on his disposition, his actions and character?Initially, F. Darcy is the man of Canon, only worse:  arrogant, prideful, haughty and even judgmental in his hurtful words towards the lady who only wishes to show care and kindness to the Darcy family.  He seems blinded by his duty to protect his family from mercenaries who are only after his family’s wealth through marriage to him.  His ungentlemanly conduct is what causes much of the angst, which are at times, heartbreaking and affecting.  Mr. Darcy’s heartfelt confessions to Elizabeth Bennet are endearing and satisfyingly soothing to the reader’s heart; while Darcy, swoon-worthy as the repentant suitor.The real star character in this variation is Elizabeth Bennet; ever impertinent yet kind, ever impulsive in condemning yet forgiving, ever rash in her eagerness to presume taking on roles yet ever caring and compassionate. This is one of those depictions of Elizabeth Bennet that will stay on in this reader’s as remarkable and memorable.The only misgiving with this story is how inconsistent the involvement of Darcy’s parents is; prominent at the start but lacking when it mattered, i.e. Georgina Darcy’s near ruin.  It would have taken the author a few lines to emphasize they sent the young Darcy to ensure Georgina’s welfare in Ramsgate. Yet, no such lines appeared which is disappointing.Nevertheless, this is still a worthwhile read for reasons above-mentioned. A 4 1/2 stars rounded up to 5. "," Quite cute. Lady Anne Darcy agreeing with Mrs Bennet, who is also called day for being married to a knight, that their children would be happy if they married!Anyone of sense agreeing with Mrs Bennet seems a strange premise, but this one works. "," - A nice storyline.- I enjoyed Darcy, Elizabeth, and Lady Anne Darcy.- After marriage, Darcy and Elizabeth's playfulness and teasing were sweet.- Mrs. Bennet was too over the top for me to enjoy. She was truly ridiculous. Which makes Mr. Bennet character drop in my opinion (even though his character only had a few lines.)- What happened with Caroline after her leading the ton on?- Some things were introduced and I have no idea what happened. "," Some interesting twists and some unexpected characters appear that make this an excellent tale. A lovely portrayal of marriage as an example to follow by our beloved couple. Thoroughly recommended! "," This is the 2nd book in the 3-volume series by Ms. Lim.  After struggling through the 1st book in the series (Oh Brother!)  I frankly was not too excited to read this next installment.  To my surprise and pleasure this is a much better crafted and edited novel.  The characters are a bit more developed, the story line is more coherent, and the cringe-worthy Mrs. Bennet is even more outrageous than ever.If you were not too impressed with the first book in this series, it may be worth your while to give this 2nd one a try.  It's a definite step up.  I, meanwhile, am off to see what volume 3 has to offer. "," I really like that both Darcy parents were alive in the variation. The story seemed a bit choppy and Mrs Bennet (a Lady in this variation) was over the top stupid.  I prefer variations with an epilogue. "," I really wanted to get into the story but too many times the author just seemed to not fill in gaps in conversations and transitioned very abruptly from scene to scene making it difficult to follow the sequence of events. Very strange "," This was a fun read.  from beginning to end it held my imagination captive often resulting smiles and sighs.  not too mushy but very believable.  and sweet. [well, except for Mrs.(Lady Bennet)]  I like sweet. "

Author","None","Y","2.99","9,037","2023-04-19","279","3.8","338","Darcy and Elizabeth meet at Pemberley months after the disastrous proposal in Kent. A frank conversation and several apologies lead to the couple getting engaged much sooner than in canon.After Kent, Darcy had confessed all to his cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam, including Wickham's presence in the militia in Meryton. Fitzwilliam keeps an eye on Wickham and prevents the elopement, meaning that Elizabeth's stay in Derbyshire is not interrupted. That does not keep Wickham from creating problems for the couple, even after Wickham is tried for desertion. Mr Bennet is unhappy about the engagement, and Jane is ... too easily led by those who do not have her best interests at heart. Mrs Bennet and Lydia are foolish and remain so.This story follows what might have happened had Darcy and Elizabeth gotten engaged upon meeting at PemberleyUpdated 5/24  Read more","I first read Pride and Prejudice in high school and, in the last few years, have discovered the world of JAFF. After reading quite a few, I thought that perhaps I could do that, and these are my attempts. I write under the pen name Melissa Anne.I began my career as a newspaper reporter before becoming a middle school English teacher and then moved to high school to teach Literature. I presently live and work in Georgia, although I grew up in East Tennessee and claim that as home. I have been married to a rather wonderful man (a cross between Darcy and Bingley, perhaps) for nearly two decades, and we have three children."," Many JAFFs are 'everybody's HEA forever' verge on fantasy - so this variant goes the other way with numerous surprises. If anything, it goes a little overboard in the other direction, with a weepy Elizabeth and a stalwart Darcy. She is excused because she is almost immediately pregnant after they marry, so her hormones are raging.But the bad news just keeps coming and she's overwhelmed. One feels sorry for her, but at the same time, this is not the Elizabeth Bennet we have come to admire and respect. There's little wit or sparkle to her, altho she does get to 'lay down the law' to several people who deserve it. But those felt more like echoes of 'the old Darcy', instead of an improved Elizabeth Darcy nee Bennet.Due to lies and deceptions, there are substantial changes to the interpersonal relationships within the Bennet family. I liked that Mary came into her own. But those scenes were very brief; it would have been nice to integrate her more closely into the new family circle that developed. The epilogue details what happens to everyone, but we never get more than a short scene of direct dialogue between the two sisters when Mary arrives in London. Then she is dropped, with only a couple of short mentions, in third-person explanations.It's a stretch to believe that the lies of Wickham and Caro Bingley would so heavily, and easily, outweigh the words of Elizabeth, Darcy, AND Bingley in the eyes of the remaining Bennets. But that is the key point upon which this story hinges.There are some very good scenes in this story, and I enjoyed most of it. YMMV, but if you can accept that the Bennets are a story of tragedy, where well-meaning people are tested and found wanting, this is a P&P tale quite different than many. "," when Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy meet again at Pemberley, it was non-stop love between the two.  now engaged, life would flow on a river of love!  right?  hardly.  and the surprising most vocal opponents were none other than Mr. Bennet and Jane Bennet.  go figure.  just when this Reader thought benignly toward both father and sister, they turn traitor.  good that both Darcy and Elizabeth are so stubbornly in love that there will be only one road for them to take - and that would be together.  the angst here was made bearable with love and hope (and lots of kissing).  yes.  a lot would happen after Lambton. "," Almost everything except for the love and engagement of Elizabeth and Darcy is quite sad.Mr Bennet refuses to give his blessings for their marriage and instead is casting his daughter off, refusing to allow her to return to see her sisters. Caroline Bingley attempts a compromise of Darcy and is sent to Yorkshire in disgrace.  Lydia is returned in disgrace from Brighton and those are actually the not so horrible events...it gets worse!Its a tale of how two individuals, working separately managed to ruin a family and create tears  that last decades.  Between Wickhams tales of woe, debts, and his inability to keep his pants on and Caroline with her wicked tongue, ability to tell disgusting stories invented of nothing, and a willingness to destroy even her own family, the two are pure toxic.Even though its quite sad its still an interesting story well written and worth the time to read it. "," Some variations are so fairy-tale like, all the sisters and Charlotte meet their one and only, Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet realize their mistakes right away and vow to change, Darcy is more dashing, Elizabeth more forgiving, etc., etc. . . Well that's not this story.  The initial premise- Darcy meets Elizabeth and they get engaged right away- is not an unusual one. But the dark turns that this story took with Mr. Bennet's refusal of the marriage was quite different.  So, 3 stars for grammar, a different plot, and a well-paced story with a good sequence of events (minus the very beginning which felt a tad rushed).  I did like the Darcy and Lizzy of this story, even if they were a bit sappy and the initial romance was a bit unbelievably rushed. . .the rest of the Bennet family though. They just kept on getting worse and worse (with the exception of Mary who was a bit of a bright light in all the gloom and Kitty who felt fairly non-existent and then neutral). I've read depressing variations before. This one was of that variety. No redemption here for Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet, Lydia, and barely any for poor Jane.And poor Bingley!! While he really didn't need redemption in this story, he sure got hammered. I don't want to put too big of a spoiler in so I'll just say, I'm fairly certain that I've never read a variation with this type of plot twist between Jane and Carolyn and Wickham.I did like that Wickham got actual consequences, and his au campaign against Darcy and Lizzy was believable and added more interest to the story.The romance was pretty much closed door  (there were a lot of references to the closed door!) and for the most part it felt realistic and sweet. Life-like and adorable, not stilted or wooden.On a minor note and possibly a bit nitpicky. At the beginning of the book, Darcy explains to Elizabeth where his name Fitzwilliam came from- Elizabeth already knew this as she had met Colonel Fitzwilliam previously at Rosings. It was just a bit jarring to have this as a conversation between then in what was supposed to be a sweet scene. "

Elizabeth had a lack of confidence she was constantly in a state of despair ( I used that word since I feel it was used the most often to describe her mood) Darcy was pushy for sex before marriage which I found uncomfortable since the behavior he was exhibiting was very predatory and not how a gentleman conducts himself. "," I remember reading through much of this authors work a year or two ago and genuinely liking it. This was disappointing.  First of all, and of least importance, there were a number of word errors.  Second, Elizabeth was very unsure of herself. Timid. She felt timid throughout the whole story and a bit whiney. There was no plot behind this at first, except her realization that she had been too harsh on Darcy.  Lastly, what was with Darcy's innuendo and pushing Elizabeth fairly constantly past where she felt comfortable with kisses, etc...? He almost felt a bit Whickham like.""Why won't you have sex with me?

Let the games begin..."," This was a creative take with some very good ideas in it. I loved how Wickham ended up ""hoisted on his own petard"", as the saying goes. And there was humor in it, which is always a positive. But I have to agree that the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth just didn't work for me.The idea was good: this time it's Elizabeth who insults Darcy. The problem is that she apparently insults a lot of people and thinks she's being witty and honest. She regrets it afterwards, but the end result is that she seriously hurts people's feelings. And that is so unlike the Elizabeth Bennet of canon, I found it impossible to like her.Darcy is rather weak in this story, which I didn't think was necessary. Again, he feels out of character; not much stronger than Bingley, in fact. There was little to admire here except his looks and wealth.I did love the expansion of Mary Bennet's character. What a hoot! She was truly a wonder in action.I rounded up the rating to 4 stars due to the many good scenes. In the end, Elizabeth and Darcy got their HEA, but it wasn't as satisfying as it could have been. YMMV. "," It was a great deal of humor in this book which is something that I really always appreciate . And it was nice to see the development of new characters and the improvement of old ones "," I LOVE all of Perpetua Langley's takeoffs on Jane Austen.  This one was probably my favorite.  I do agree with Avid Reader's 5 Star review that Elizabeth was maybe a bit too harsh and impulsive and maybe not as likeable as I would have preferred but I'm still in for 5 Stars.  I loved how the stories of the other main cast of characters were pushed forward and explored and tweaked about - in a unique way we wouldn't have thought to rearrange them ourselves!  If you are a Jane Austen purist, go read Pride and Prejudice again but if you enjoy a charming fun true-to-the era spin on the original once in awhile, you won't go wrong here! "," A bit of a romp but not terribly funny IMHO but humor is like tasting food. Not everyone has the same experience with the same food or humor. I would download the sample and give it a try. You might love the book. "," This is one of the worst variations I have read.  The characters are all one dimensional.  Elizabeth is an out of control shrew with a permanent,constant case of PMS.  Darcy is a gutless, shallow wimp who will take the blame no matter how preposterous or how innocent he might be.  Wickham finds pushing Daddy's buttons so easy that he is bored with Darcy by the end.  I was equally bored with Wickham by the end because Darcy caved in so quickly to Wickham.  The Scottish parable teller was OK for the first chapter.  After his third story, I was in agreement with Darcy, ""Just shoot me!!"" .  Why not one star?  Because the author made the effort to write the book and had a decent plot with some potential. She squandered it with her one-dimensional characters. "," In this version, filled with humor, it's Elizabeth who insults Darcy at the Merton Assembly, and Darcy who overhears her.  And so it goes on. Very enjoyable. "," A beautifully written story. I enjoyed every page. "," I wish I could give this a higher rating but really didn't like Elizabeth in this story. She was mean and kind of reminded me of caroline bingley "

It means the Bennet family is in dire straits and Mrs. Bennet has even more motivation to sell her daughters to the highest bidder.So, even if Fitzwilliam Darcy falls desperately, passionately in love with Elizabeth, it would be crazy to propose marriage, right?

It’s the kind of story where you are dropped smack into the middle of a world and find out how things work as you go along, so to enjoy it you need to be able to go with the flow and take things as thy come. I found it compelling, though there are a few details about how things work I wish had been fleshed out a bit more (more on that under spoilers). The writing style sometimes— disjointed. But I suspect it was done purposely as I found it brought me that much more into the feel of a disjointed world, you know, dystopia.As a JAFF:It mostly works well.  The chastity laws for women and the consequences for breaking them are even more deadly serious than in the Regency era, and it’s chilling what can happen to a woman and then she’s killed for it. Darcy and Lizzy make sense as the same people but having been formed by this environment. I expected Darcy to be coming from more of a place of privilege than he is, unlike Elizabeth he’s a citizen, but he’s struggling under the oppressive society as much as anyone else, that mostly works, but I was a little confused about what privileges citizen’s actually have, or how much better off than Lizzy he was meant to be.There’s enough of the story playing out in a different world to make it recognizable as P&P and there’s a lot of creativity in the way some of the scenes are updated for the time period, at the same time, it’s different enough that I didn’t know what was coming. Some of the characters are similar to who they were in the original and some are used in interesting ways. Colonel Fitzwilliam only appears briefly but in such a way that I found him possibly the most noble and interesting character and wished we got more of his story (though it’s in keeping with the original that we don’t).The only thing that didn’t work for me as JAFF was the ending, while mostly happy for Lizzy and Darcy, it didn’t leave me with any hope (more on that under spoilers).There’s enough jammed into the epilog for another book and IMO that’s something the author should consider. I think fleshed out it would make a fascinating story. As an epilog it’s a bit of data dump though and ends on a depressing note.Spoilers from here:....Plot points I found a bit confusing:I’m not clear on the privileges of a citizen verses a non-citizen. The chastity laws and harsh punishments for breaking them seem to apply to both. The curfew is for both, but then when they are out after curfew Lizzy doesn’t get in trouble because Darcy says she’s with him. Are they simply more likely to overlook it if a citizen breaks curfew? Also, Darcy makes it sound like they were having sex, wouldn’t that also get her into trouble for breaking the chastity laws? Or does he assume she would pass a virginity test, but isn’t that an awfully big assumption and wouldn’t she be annoyed with him for putting her at risk?Darcy wants to be Lizzy’s “protector” and offers her money for it. He’s been saving money because he might need it as a bribe to save Georgiana. So, wouldn’t paying Lizzy mean risking not having the money to save Georgiana? Would he really take that risk? Also, if she took that deal, wouldn’t that put her life at risk because of the chastity laws? Or would it be overlooked as long as she has a citizen-protector but if he dumped her she’d be at risk? And either way, that could have worked well as a parallel if she’d called him on saying he loves her but putting her life at risk (or not giving her any guarantee that she won’t be at risk when he gets tired of her) but that isn’t the part about it that bothers her.What bothered me about the ending:It was a happy ending for Lizzy and Darcy (mostly) but there was something about the two of them escaping and leaving so many people they cared about in a bad situation that didn’t set well with me. This was particularly highlighted by the way the author switched to a time jump format near the end. A sweet scene between Darcy and Lizzy (afterward) was  interspersed with Darcy in danger, which highlighted for me the danger everyone they leave behind will still be in. And the Epilog reinforced that impression, especially when one of the characters I cared about had harsh ending after a life that didn’t seem to have a moment of happiness. (On the other hand kudos to the author for making me care so much about a minor character that his story hit me in the gut like it did.)This might just be me though, others might not be bothered by these things.Overall a unique story well worth reading. "," What could be more natural?Often in such extreme experiments the original characters are unrecognizable, just names. But that is not the case in this science fiction novel.  We live through what the ups and downs in Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship are like in a destroyed world full of dangers of both human and nonhuman origin. Classism and sexism play strong roles. The end of the story is surreal.As a fan of both scifi and P&P fanfiction, I very much "," I am a huge fan of sci fi. It’s my first love. My second is P&P romance. This is an amazing work and I highly recommend it. Of all the P&P I have read (hundreds), this might be my favorite, due to its sci-fi twist. Very original. "," I've read a few of this author's stories, and this one was the most confusing.Based off the summary I was so excited to read this. It  started off easy to follow, but the more I read the more I got confused. The author seems to jump back and forth from present to past/future. Any other themed book would be easier to follow, but a sci-fi makes it hard to understand whats going on. There is an especially difficult part of the book where it jumps from the future and the present with no explanation or anything. "," The concept was interesting, although there were too many jumps and too much left to the imagination. It felt unfinished and character development felt forced. And the epilogue did help explain things, but it should have been better distributed through the book itself, as I felt very unsatisfied when I finished. "," This variation may shock many P&P fans for its content. The crude language, the devastating scenes which involve dismal situations and the depressing mood does not help much to promote this variation involving a dystopian society filled with cynical characters living angst-filled lives.However, what makes this cringe-worthy is also what makes it so unforgettable and novel that I would recommend this to every fan of Pride and Prejudice…as long as the reader is able to get past its oddity. Not for the faint of heart. "," I liked this book, more than I thought I would but it is definitely not for everyone. The dystopian/sci-fi setting can be incredibly confusing for someone who just reads Regency/historical romance, however, if you are used to sci-fi/fantasy books, it's fairly easy to just roll with it and enjoy the romance.The writing style feels somehow disjointed but I found it works for me - it somehow manages to convey the angst, conflicted feelings, etc. My recommendation is to read the preview - if it works for you, chances are the book will too. It will also give you a good idea of the level of grittiness and if it's too much for you. "," I'm not at avid reader of the ""fantasy"" genre, or in this case ""Distopian future"", but I really enjoyed this book. I started reading the book around 2pm and finished by 8, I just couldn't put it down.I will say this book adds more cursing and talk about see that you would want to see in a Jane Austen Variation, but otherwise it is a very fun and interesting book.

Mary Bennet is actually quite the central figure in this one - reticent and always willing to remain in the shadows.  and lucky for ODC, because it is in those very shadows that Mary overhears a secret - and the answer to her sister Elizabeth's melancholy these past months, and years.  Mary will take the initiative of reintroducing the estranged couple, and, as Fate would have it, she would find her own happiness.  this was a very rewarding read, unlike parts one and two which were unnecessarily short and, well, almost frustrating. so, multiple happy endings are a good thing - no?? "," A rather short but very emotional variation inspired by author Jane Austen’s classic novel Pride and Prejudice by Meg Osborne. I enjoy her stories but i wish she’d just make one complete book instead of three short ones for each story. "," Without any spoilers (I am dead set against them), I found this to be a lovely conclusion to a very readable P&P variation series. "

Collecting marriage proposals like handkerchiefs, Elizabeth wonders if she might have spurned her one chance at lasting happiness when she learns that Mr Darcy is not at all who she believed him to be.Darcy is tired of fighting his feelings. His heart knows what it wants, and that is Elizabeth Bennet. When he learns that Mr Bennet has passed away, he imagines riding in as the white knight, a saviour come to rescue his beloved from a life of poverty. But when he reaches Hertfordshire, something is amiss and he finds that Elizabeth needs no rescuing, thank you very much.

A voracious reader, this led her to the novel which, in turn, led to the discovery of Jane Austen's other excellent works, Persuasion being her favorite. She stumbled upon the genre of JAFF in 2019 and was hooked. After reading so many variations and imaging storylines of her own, she began writing them down and, for the first time, discovered her passion in life.Melissa lives in Alaska with her husband of sixteen years-a delightful combination of Mr. Darcy and Mr. Tilney-their five children, and a great behemoth of a dog, Knightley. When not reading or writing, which is not very often, Melissa enjoys camping in the wild Alaskan frontier, baking, yoga-ing...yoging...doing yoga, and riding her motorcycle in the most beautiful place on earth. And sleeping. Sleeping is the best."," Kudos to Melissa Halcomb. I have probably read a thousand P&P stories. (It's my dirty little secret, can't get enough) and this is one of a handful where I have given 5 stars. In this story Mr Bennett hides that he has inhereted a vast sum as well as 2 properties from a dear uncle. Whom he thought ashamed of his choice in bride. Hi uncles last request was for Mr Bennett to provide for his 2 young daughters and any future children. In keeping with his uncles final request he invests 30k into his brother-inlaw Gardiners new business, sets up a 30k dowry for each of his daughters and secretly buys Netherfield Park for Jane to be mistress. He thought it would be a grand joke if his family found out they were rich upon his death like his uncle had done to him. Since Jane is the only daughter of age and with property they all move into Nethertield Park. Jane find a will of Iron as she comes into her own fortune as mistress of Netherfield. There she hires governesses for the 2 youngest girls who are no longer OUT. Masters for everyone else. Lizzy is required to practice piano and learn to ride. They all attempt to gain accomplishment. Even Mrs Bennett is taking instruction from a companion. Mr Darcy thinking he is saving Elizabeth from destitution rides in an bungled a marriage proposal. He's quickly rejected. Mr Wickham also proposes to Lizzy and is rejected. She was already disillusioned from him but after Darcy discloses his sorted history during his justification of his behavior she let's Wickham know in no uncertain terms that she is aware of his true character. They summer at Lizzys Beach cottage and meet a wealthy, well connected Mr Hawthorne who only has eyes for Mrs Bennett. They fall in love and meet at Lizzy and Jane's London town home...only 2 door down from Mr Darcys Town home. They reconnect as neighbors and begin a friendship anew. Jane meets Col. Fitzwilliam and is attracted to his maturity and kindness. Everything you want to happen does, bad guys get their come ups in. Collins & Wickham. Jane DOES NOT end up with Mr Bingley. Who eventually grows a spine of his own. And surprise surprise Mrs Bennett fall madly in love as well with the 3rd best man in the book. Oh and Lydia is still Lydia, but without too much collateral damage along the way. Loved it! 😍 "," This could also be titled, ""How Jane Grew a Backbone"" as it's a surprising transformation of the eldest Bennet sister. Mr. Bennet dies, and his will shocks his wife and daughters. Years ago he inherited a wealthy uncle's estate, but refused to tell anyone except his brothers-in-law. Far from being thrown into the hedgerows, the remaining Bennets can now live a prosperous and comfortable life.Mr. Collins gladly inherits Longbourn, only to be unpleasantly surprised to find his Bennet relatives have become extremely wealthy – and own not just one home, but three – and one of them is a London townhouse in Mayfair!The family agrees it's best if no one else learns of their new-found wealth. The prospects for marriage for the Bennet daughters are now much rosier. But will Elizabeth ever overcome her distaste for the arrogant Mr. Darcy? Does Jane forever pine for the agreeable Mr. Bingley? And why is Wickham suddenly trying to force his attentions upon the Bennet daughters again?We get some lovely comeuppance of the detestable Miss Bingley, as well as an unexpected romance for one of the Bennets.I really enjoyed how Jane took over as head of the family after their father dies. So many stories have Elizabeth taking charge, but this time, Jane gets to straighten out the tangled chaos of Bennet family life – and does an exceptionally good job of it!Highly recommended, especially for those who like to see Darcy humble himself (deservedly) and have Colonel Fitzwilliam be given a bigger role in the action. "," I hope this author keeps writing JAFF. I'm looking forward to her next creation. Mr Bennett pulls a fast one on his whole family, and never reveals to them that he inherited a huge fortune and several properties from a beloved uncle. Not until his death, and the reading of his will, do any of them discover that they have nothing to worry about, their future is not just secure, but they're actually wealthy. He bequeaths the properties to Jane and Elizabeth, and a very respectable dowry to each of the ladies, including Mrs Bennett. The reaction to this revelation is mixed.I particularly like Jane in this version. She becomes mistress of Netherfield, one of the properties acquired by Mr Bennett before his death, and the family moves there, but this is not our usual serene and non-confrontational Jane. She throws off her rose colored glasses, and decides that it's now on her to make her family more respectable. She lays down the law for everyone, including Mrs Bennett and even Elizabeth. I wanted to cheer, and say, ""Way to go, girl!!"" It's wonderful.The story begins the January after Netherfield is abandoned by the Bingleys and Darcy. Darcy is still fighting his strong attraction to Elizabeth. Elizabeth still dislikes Darcy, but starts to have some misgivings about Wickham. When Darcy finally learns from Lady Catherine that Mr Bennett has died, he believes that Elizabeth is probably destitute, and he resolves to marry her and save her from penury. Darcy goes to Netherfield, and presents his disastrous proposal, and is refused soundly. Because one of the inherited properties is a house in London, the Bennetts and Darcy cross paths again, and Darcy grasps at a second chance.There are a lot of fun and interesting twists in the Bennett family saga because they now have money and several homes. Although the usual villains are included, several wonderful new characters are introduced. The author has a talent for writing clever and amusing banter, which is nice. The romance is lovely. This is a swoon worthy Darcy, and a pleasantly feisty Elizabeth. The book is well written and well edited. I recommend it highly. "

Darcy can no longer fight his attraction for Elizabeth and makes his feelings known. Elizabeth has hidden feelings for Darcy. Elizabeth is also willing to consider Darcy's warning concerning Wickham. "," No real plot just a sex scene at a ball and Elizabeth accepting a proposal before learning the truth about Darcy and Wickham. "," This is not even a novella, really  a short story. Following the original, less details, Darcy and Elizabeth have an unexpected tryst in a guest room at Netherfield. It would make  a better story of they had stopped before having sex.

The hot sex between Darcy and Elizabeth is on fire. Elizabeth mistakes his reason for having sex. Oh Wickham you made it worse. "," Our beloved couple here have no self control whatsoever; so altered are they that they bother not for propriety, nor honor.  The other reasons for Darcy marrying Elizabeth are merely secondary to wanting to bed her whenever he wants.  This objectifies the strong character that is Elizabeth Bennet. What a shameful depiction! Furthermore, her agreeing to the marriage due to her need to save her reputation is hardly a good foundation for a solid marriage.  Even the issue of Wickham is forgotten not to mention his arrogance and conceit and his thinking that her family and all of Hertfordshire society beneath him.

"," I received a free copy in exchange for a review, and here it is! Overall, this was a fun, fast read. Yes, diehard Austen fans will have to suspend belief of their favorite characters, because our author doesn't keep to the traditional ""thoughts and actions"" of Darcy or Lizzy - so if you're someone who dislikes when authors venture off and stray away from Austen's characters, you may not like this.Without giving too much away, an accident happens which causes Lizzy's dress to rip while at a ball, and while she's waiting in a guestroom, Darcy, who has been following her, enters the room. From the author's description, I'm sure you can figure out what happens next. ;) But sticking true to Austen's characters and her original story, misunderstandings follow - and I'm sure you all remember the impact with those!Again, you have to suspend what you traditionally know about the characters and allow yourself to let Lizzy and Darcy give into their physical lust during the Netherfield Ball. It's a short but sweet scene, not too graphic or off-putting as other JAFF ""adult themed"" books I've read. A solid 3 star read; it's enjoyable, fun, a little steamy ;), and still that HAE that we all want for Darcy and Lizzy. "," Mr. Darcy portrayed as a rapist .  Jane Austen is flipping in her grave.  This poorly written garbage had to be self published.  No self respecting publisher would tough it. "

How does our heroine react to his proposal and the behaviour that she has witnessed from Darcy up to that point in the story? The traditional villains from Pride and Prejudice that we all love to hate make an appearance in my story BUT they are not the focus. Other than Miss Bingley, whose character provides the small amount of angst in this tale, they play a very small role and are dealt with quickly. If dear reader you are looking for an angst filled tale rife with dastardly attempts to disrupt ODC then I am sorry to say, you will not find that in my book.This story is about the consequences of the decisions made by the characters portrayed within. Along with Darcy and Elizabeth, we examine the trajectory of the supporting character’s lives around them. How are they affected by decisions taken by ODC coupled with the decisions that they make themselves? How do the decisions taken by members of the Bingley/Hurst family affect them and their lives? The Bennets are assumed to be extremely wealthy for the purposes of my tale, the source of that wealth is explained during the telling of this story. The wealth, like so much in this story is a consequence of decisions made Thomas Bennet and Edward Gardiner.If you like a sweet and clean, low angst story, then dear reader, sit back, pour yourself a glass of your favourite drink and read, because this book is for you.

Like many high school students, Pride and Prejudice was assigned to me in an English literature class when I was 15. It was not my favourite book, which was true of any book I was forced to read at that period ion my life. Under protest I read it in order to pass the class. I forgot about the book until I was in my 30’s when in 2004 I found and watched, and then fell in love with, the 1995 Pride and Prejudice version made for TV in England. I purchased a copy of the DVD which has been watched more times that I can count. The tipping point was when I saw the 2005 big screen adaption of P&amp;P. Not long after I acquired and read the complete works of Jane Austen on Amazon. Reading e-books is my way of giving back to the environment. I read them all starting with Pride and Prejudice. P&amp;P is my favourite by far of all of Miss Austen's works, or any other for that matter. After I read it three of four times over, one day I wistfully said to myself: ‘it is a great pity that Miss Austen never wrote a sequel to her seminal novel.' I was searching the Kindle Store for books and for the hell of it I entered “Pride and Prejudice Sequel’ into the search bar not expecting any results. The rest is history. I discovered the myriad of JAFF books. Once I devoured all of the sequels and continuations that I could find, I reluctantly tried a variation. I had the wrong-headed belief that variations were not as good as sequels. Boy was I ever wrong! The more that I read, the more I started getting ideas and hear stories in my head, so I decided to start writing, something that I never imagined in my wildest dreams that I would ever do. Today I am the proud owner of well over 1,000 JAFF novels that I have acquired on Amazon. ‘A Change of Fortunes’ is the first book that I have written. There are a number more in the works, it seems that the more I write, the more I want to write."," Although this author's JAFF variations become somewhat repetitive, they're fun and satisfying to read because the main characters are more forthright than the usual Regency era romances, and because the villains get the most spectacular comeuppances. This story reimagines the Bennett family as having vast wealth, due to Mr Bennett's foresight, and Uncle Gardiners' brilliance in business. When the Bingleys and Darcy come to Netherfield Park, the Bennetts are concealing their wealth from everyone in order to avoid fortune hunters. Only Mr Bennett, Jane and Elizabeth (along with the Gardiners) know about the wealth. Darcy delivers his insult at the Meryton assembly, and as per usual, finally succumbs to his attraction to Elizabeth during her visit to Charlotte Collins at Rosings. He performs his awful proposal, is roundly refused, and writes her the letter defending himself against her accusations. This time, however, she wants to discuss the letter with him, and this is when she rakes Darcy over the coals for being a hypocrite.Elizabeth's setdown to Darcy is epic and wonderful. The usual villains, namely Caroline Bingley, Lady Catherine, and Wickham, each get what's coming to them. The Bennetts aren't just wealthy, they're obscenely wealthy, and this fact changes the whole dynamic for the family. The author has a population of accessory characters that she uses in most of her books, so it's kind of like seeing old familiar faces.I deducted a star for a couple of reasons. One is the dizzying amount of accessory characters involved, and how they're named in detail with every little change in situation and location. The other reason is the exaggerated extent of wealth in the Bennett family, and even in most of their connections. It seemed excessive, obscene, and unnecessary. Just an average amount of wealth would have been less intimidating, and less ridiculous.The book is well written and well edited. I recommend it highly. "," I like this author’s work.  I’ve read several of her books and enjoyed them.  I particularly  enjoy the “what if Elizabeth were secretly rich, royal, or highly connected” scenario. Ms Ganderson has style, creativity and a feeling for her characters that brings them to life.  However, despite the notation posted with the electronic version of the Hypocrite stating that it has been updated and corrected, what she still doesn’t have, and needs desperately, is a decent editor.  That fact is glaringly evident in this book because it is much longer than her other works that I’ve read and the same mistakes are repeated over and over.  There are not that many grammatical errors, very few, in fact, but there are numerous missing words or excess words where the author changed direction in mid-sentence, literally dozens of instances where “that” is used when “than” is meant, mixed gender references where a character is referred to as both masculine and feminine in the same sentence, and words used incorrectly (reign for a horse’s rein).The most glaring fault is one that a good editor would have zeroed in on quickly. The book is simply too long and much too repetitive.  Readers don’t need to know characters’ inner most thoughts if they are about to repeat them aloud.  We also don’t need to hear the same words spoken by one character multiple times to different audiences. Once is enough.  There are so many pages between the well-designed beginning and the happy ending that the reader forgets the first before coming to the last.  Judicious cutting in the right places would have turned this good story into a great one.Despite having enjoyed the book, I gave it only three stars because of the editorial problems.  I hope the author will find a way to get the editing help her work deserves to make it really shine. . "," I have mixed feelings about this one.  First, the plot premise is beyond belief — the Bennets are supposedly richer than the royal family and yet the author would have you believe that this is hidden because Bennet is afraid his wife will spend too much money!?  Then, the book seems to go on forever....endless recital of family connections, ownership of property, amount of wealth and excruciating detail on how wealth acquired.  All of the assigned “irritants” of the piece — Wickham, Lady Catherine, Mrs. Bennet, Lydia, Caroline—- are dealt with before you’re even 40% into the story; 2 of them to madness.  What is left is just endless smooth sailing through endless perfect lives and perfect loves.  I enjoyed the basic plot, but the author could have edited away half of it and it would have been a much more enjoyable read.  Perfect people with perfect, extremely privileged lives gets too boring for me.  Finally, I had too laugh when the characters were so good that one of them was actually praised for gifting a new water bucket to a tenant replacing a 12 year old bucket with a hole in it, thus saving the tenants from endless trips to the well. This particular couple had a combined income of over £25,000 a year and the outlay for the bucket in the early 1800s must have set the owner back 4-5 shillings.  Just too many constant pats on the back for every single Bennet or connected family, relative, in-law or spouse. "

Finding that no family exists Bennet takes her back to Hertfordshire where his wife doesn't want her. Unfortunately Mrs Bennet dies in what they thought was childbirth but was actually cancer, leaving him with his daughter Jane and the newest addition Elizabeth. He had not been in love with his wife but with Sarah Lucas who had lost her husband a year before leaving her with Charlotte. They end up married finally and blend the family successfully.  Mr Bennet saves the life of the King and Queen when their carriage almost hits a tree and he's made the Duke of Hertfordshire, given several properties and an astronomical amount of cash!  It changes him and the family into a highly successful and respected member of the community and the entire life of the family changes with governess, tutors, and a huge new Longbourne.Eventually Elizabeth's biological family find her and she is related to the Earl Matlock and a huge cast of high Ton, including the Darcy family.It's a very positive story with a few incidents of trouble especially with a delusional Caroline Bingley.  I enjoy reading the genre of Rich Bennet and Elizabeth Isn't A Bennet stories because they can go almost anywhere.  I admit I read part of this story while it was being written on a fan fiction site but never finished it. Its quite well written as all of Ms Granderson's works are. "," 4 stars rounded up to 5 stars,  ;). 4 stars because the writing is kind of choppy, especially in the begining but 5 stars because the story is pretty fun. Lots of new characters with very similar names which made keeping track of them almost impossible so I quit trying about half way. Much like having 4 or 5 ferret running around in a large house.One thing I took away from the story was there was nothing more dangerous in the world than riding in a carriage. People were dropping like flies. King George the III and the queen nearly died in a carriage. Luckily Mr. Bennet saved them.The amount of happy people in the story was amazing. Everyone was finding their one true love constantly. Lots of humor which might have only been funny to me.SpoilerBest bad guy in JAFF in a long tome. Mr. Willoughby from Sense and Sensibility make a short entrance. He and a friend are hilarious and gone as fast as they came into the story. "," Shana Granderson populates many of her creations with the same accessory characters, characters other than the ones borrowed from P&P, so when you read her works it's almost like reconnecting with old friends. This one is no exception. In addition to that, she writes the most spectacular setdowns for the villains, and the main characters are much more forthright than in the usual Regency era fare. Although this is enjoyable, after this many books with pretty much the same situations, it is beginning to become repetitious. Elizabeth is born to a curate and his wife. The curate is the younger son of an earl, and his father has disowned him because he objects to his son's calling to be a clergyman. After Elizabeth is born, there's a fire which takes the lives of both of her parents. But before they die, Elizabeth is entrusted to Mr Bennett, who just happens to be nearby during the disaster. Elizabeth is raised in a loving home where she's treated as another daughter.There are many complicated circumstances that result in fabulous wealth for the Bennetts, and many noble connections for Elizabeth, although it's many years before that's discovered. Elizabeth is lost to her relations when she's a baby, given to Mr Bennett, and they're always looking for her, a theme that this author has used several times. This time, though, there's nothing sinister about Elizabeth's disappearance as a child.The book is well written. As usual, there's a lot of tedious detail that could have been omitted without sacrificing any of the integrity of the story. Details such as who rode with whom in which carriage, the order in which people enter or exit a room, the mechanics of a servant preparing the tea, etc. Some detail is useful, but this much is excessive. Also, it's a little too tidy the way everyone suddenly gets married off. In this one, it's the three eldest Bennett girls marrying the two Fitzwilliam brothers and Darcy. Way too tidy.However, the story is enjoyable, well done, and well edited. I recommend it. "," Granderson’s P&P variations are well written and are a pleasure to read if you can accept that they tend to be basically the same plot; there’s usually a few subplots that differentiate one from the other. The rating for this variation is higher than it deserves simply because I enjoy any variation in which Fanny and Lydia Bennet of canon are not prominent characters or simply not written into the novel. And, I greatly prefer that Jane does not marry Bingley. Every other true to canon story line u is a acceptable for me. "," Imaginative plot and storyline. Written, for the most part in a lively, natural flowing manner.  A little of the discourse between Elizabeth and Darcy seemed forced, or awkward. Even with that it was a most enjoyable read. I highly recommend it! "," Great cover! To sum up the plot, Bennet adopts baby Lizzy, after she is orphaned. Her biological family’s looking for her and eventually finds her. There’s a lot of couples thrown in, little angst. After a dramatic, solid start, the story becomes a slow burn, no pun intended. Not the best from this author, the second half of the story needed a lot of oomph. There were some other Austen crossovers but didn’t add to the story. There were new characters too but they weren’t interesting to me. "," Unbeknownst to me,  this is exactly what I've been waiting for.  The change in the characters' storyline,  their characters & who some of them end up with is genius. This is a must-read if you're looking for something different. "

Book 1 was essentially just a summary of Ms. Austen's original novel with tiny bits of original content sprinkled in. I started to worry that this was a story where the ""what-if"" would make absolutely no difference to the outcome of the story. Even with the insights of the letter, Elizabeth still doesn't like Darcy, D is still determined that he can't marry E. The only real major difference is that E doesn't entirely trust Wickham. There was very little dialogue, and what there was was pulled word for word from the original with only an occasional alteration to fit E's knowledge of the letter. What very little original content there was was interesting and well written, there just wasn't nearly enough. Up until just after Collins proposal, very little was different from P&P. I've already read that book...a lot. I read JAFF becuz I want more, not to read a summary of the original.Book 2 was nothing but one big, long therapy session. Every conversation was overly long and designed to teach someone a lesson or discuss the lesson which was learned. There was ZERO light-hearted banter, even between ODC. Long-winded conversations about how everyone was growing and changing and why they were growing and changing and what they were doing so they were growing and changing over and over and over made this such a chore to read! If anyone was speaking (with the sole exception of Mrs. Bennet) it was to hash over some deep, soul-searching epiphany. And no one (of the main characters with the sole exception of Mrs. Bennet) was exempt. Elizabeth, Jane, Mary, Kitty, Lydia, Darcy, Bingley, Mr. Bennet--we got to read all of their soul-searching. It was sweet to read the Bennet sisters coming together and taking charge of their own futures and helping one another, it just needed to be whittled down drastically. And the romance between ODC felt like a side arc. This was really a book about the Bennet sisters which happened to include that two of them fall in love and get married.I noted a few grammatical errors, though nothing so grievous as to making it overly distracting. Although, the author used British-English spelling on some words and American-English spelling on others. And, it's entirely my own nitpicking, but I hate the use of parentheses in dialogue. It disrupts the flow and and seems as if the writer had something to convey but didn't know how or didn't trust their own writing to make the point or the reader to understand, so just threw the thought in ( )'s.I cannot recommend this book as it was just such a chore. It desperately needed to be cut down in length and moralizing. E is meant to be this happy, lighthearted character but she was such a downer throughout and never really improved. Oh, goodness, and the epilogue was just...weird. Which was such a disappointment and the prologue was so well written and intriguing. I gave three stars for the originality of the idea and for original content (with the exception of dialogue) being well-written. "," Elizabeth finds a letter on her walk from a person she's unfamiliar with about events that haven't happened yet.  She knows no one named Bingley, Darcy , or Wickham and the events recounted in the letter are not familiar. As she walks home she learns that a Bingley has leased Netherfield.  First idea that sometime is happening.  Many of the actual events still occur but we have a more obnoxious Darcy and a more thoughtful Elizabeth. Because of the letter she's gained a bit of knowledge regarding Wickhams reasons for telling her his story after knowing her for less than an hour. She's able to see what Darcy's looks are about and its not to find fault.  A great deal of this story is about abandonment, both physical and the emotional. Bingley and Darcy did the physical abandonment but Mr Bennet has done the emotional part and his actions regarding his family have hurt all. When called out by Mr Gardiner for this he leaves. He dumped the running of Longbourne onto Elizabeth's lap and goes to visit a University friend for an undetermined length of time.  The girls have to band together to manage both Mrs Bennet and Longbourne.I found the level of pain these 5 young women go through stressful but it brings them closer together.  Even Lydia gets a jolt of reckoning because of her near elopement with Wickham and turns towards her sisters and eventually even Georgiana who was his previous victim.  I enjoyed reading this very much especially when we only had to deal with Lady Catherine and the Collins' long distance. "," Darcy’s letter to Lizzy after the parish proposal is sent back in time and lands at her feet a few days before Bingley takes possession of Netherfied Park. The hand of fate sent the letter back in time.Between the letter and advice from Aunt Gardiner, Lizzy and her sisters decide they are miserable because they have unequal affection from their parents and everyone is scared to death about being in the poorhouse poor should their father die.From this point on there much talk about what type of person they should marry and how awful all the customs of their society are. Much, much talk. Too much talk.The old unimproved Darcy is not much fun to be around and he knows he didn’t write the letter so who forged it and why? Much, much more talk.Mr. Bennet isn’t very happy being thought of as scum of the earth by his family so he goes on a vacation, gives all of the estate books to Lizzy and tells her she is in charge. Much, much talk ensues.By this time the Bennet sisters have talked enough that they form a philosophy cult and move away. I made that last part up but I wouldn’t have been surprised if it had happened.The rest of the book is about talking and everyone trying to get to a new normal.I didn’t enjoy it very much but my tastes are random enough that others may very well enjoy it immensely. It’s a Kindle Unlimited so there is that. "," the Letter.  Elizabeth, on Oakham Mount, finds a letter, sealed and perfectly crisp.  dare she open it?  no.  but, then - yes.  her natural curiosity and her desire to return the missive to its owner, would be her guide. but the prior 3 days rain, the surrounding dampness, how was this letter so pristine?  but, just like the proverbial Pandora's Box, this letter would be a beginning of a series of questions with not so many answers.  the book itself is long. very long. incredibly long.  but this Reader was so caught up with the story, that the Letter kept silent in its background.  until The End.  and then, this Reader went back and read the Prologue.  duh.  that is really a big, big hint.  but enjoy this pre-Rosings Elizabeth and Darcy and all those complicated Bennets. or, was it post-Rosings Elizabeth and Darcy ??

Jealous that Fitzwilliam had been born first, Alexander had found purpose in tormenting his reticent brother in every conceivable way. After their father’s death, however, he found himself at the mercy of the person he always resented.By chance, Elizabeth Bennet met Alexander Darcy the summer he visited Charles Bingley at Netherfield Park.

No artificial intelligence was used in the making of this book.Before my obsession with all things Jane Austen, I worked as an administrative assistant to the president of a CPA firm. No longer working, I enjoy spending time with my family and indulging my love of storytelling. Born on a farm in Cullman, Alabama, I proudly admit to being a country girl, and after years of living in the city, I finally achieved my dream of moving back to the country. My husband and I now reside on a three acre mini-farm, sporting chickens and numerous rescued dogs and cats. Always a voracious reader, I rediscovered Jane Austen books after watching the 2005 Pride and Prejudice movie. Searching for everything relating to Miss Austen, I eventually stumbled into the world of Jane Austen Fan Fiction. After reading many of other people’s stories, I decided to try my hand at writing a tale that kept coming to mind and began posting that story on online in 2009. By November of 2010, I started my own forum, DarcyandLizzy.com, and many readers followed me to this site. Several of my friends insisted that I publish, and in April 2011, Fitzwilliam Darcy an Honourable Man became available. I have since published the following novels: Mr. Darcy’s Forbidden Love, Darcy and Elizabeth, A Most Unlikely Couple, Darcy and Elizabeth - A Promise Kept, Passages - A Pemberley Tale, Proof Of Love - A Pemberley Tale, Taking Another Chance. I also published two novellas - A Twist of Fate and An Angel In Her Pocket.I post all my stories on the forum before I publish them and, just to set the record straight, any similarity between the names in my books and those of television or movie characters is purely coincidental. I have never watched soap operas and I watch little TV/movies other than BBC productions and those relating to the 1800s.

I loved Colonel Fitzwilliam and his role in this story. "," I really wavered between a 3-star and 4-star on this, but remembering the price I paid for it, I went with three stars. Overall, this story had so much potential and when it was good, it was quite good. Unfortunately a few things really began to grate and when I finally turned the last page, I wasn't really satisfied as a reader.First of all, Elizabeth runs right up to the edge of stupid (and honestly, tips over that edge) in her stubborn belief that Alex is the good Darcy and Fitzwilliam is the bad ... despite all of the evidence claiming otherwise. Wickham and Alex tell her Fitzwilliam is bad, and even though Alex kisses her without permission, takes off despite a promise to marry, despite family and friends encouraging her to see the truth, she holds onto to the belief that Fitzwilliam is bad until finally, FINALLY, she accepts that she was wrong. Quite frankly, this came just in time, because I was getting beyond frustrated and on the verge of hating the story.And of course, the BIG misunderstanding and break comes, and that didn't bother me so much ... but I felt incredibly let down that we don't even see Fitzwilliam and Elizabeth have their reunion. After all those pages of separation and angst, Elizabeth returns and Fitzwilliam stirs from fever and injury ... and that's it. The next scene fast forwards several months, we don't see their reunion, we don't see them declaring their love again (until much later) and I can't believe the author chose to torture us (and the characters) so long without any emotional payoff. Instead that was skipped and suddenly, everything is a happy ever after. It was a cheap ending and a cheap way to treat readers, especially since all of the declarations and explanations came from third parties instead of each other.Seriously, a six-hundred page story and not even a few pages can be spent on giving us that reunion after a long separation and all that pain? Just a shabby way to wrap up the story, honestly. Three stars. "," This variation revolved around a set of twin brothers, Fitzwilliam and Alexander. Fitzwilliam the stoic, reserved and duty bound twin; while Alexander is the direct opposite.  Their relationship is like water and oil they don’t mix. Alexander jealousy of Fitzwilliam made him disliked his brother. He would  do anything to make life miserable for Fitzwilliam even trapped him in a marriage with a girl that he, Alexander compromised  and later tried to destroy it.I found this story griping it has the right amount of angst.  The characterizations of the main characters were well developed. There were a new character, Lady Ashly, a voice of reason to Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam.  However, the beginning resemble of another variation “The Most Unlikely Couple” by this writer which took a while to get involved in the story.  Once I did I couldn’t put it down until the climax, it’s wasn’t finished,  I was waiting for Elizabeth comes to face to face with Alexander.  Overall I liked this variation and would recommend it. "," I loved Lizzy and liked how she dealt with Alexander,finally. I loved Aunt Rose she was smart and gave great advice when needed and a good kick in the rear when called for . Loved the epilogue, that is usually a good wrap up to your stories. Love your books ready for the sequels. "," I agree with other reviewers who say the ending is a disappointment. For 600 pages Darcy is psychologically tortured not only by his worthless brother and Wickham but also by a rather cold and dimwitted Elizabeth who refuses to see the truth for far too long. As readers I think we deserved a resolution that was a bit more nuanced than ""and six months later they all lived happily ever after."" Rather than an epilogue filled with a dry recitation of all the progeny of every branch of the family, I would have liked to see a proper reunion and clearing of the misunderstandings. Darcy's twin Alexander's deeds were truly worthy of the severest condemnation but when it finally came to light everyone just sort of shrugged their shoulders. And after he's effectively ""let off,"" he vows to ""be a better man."" *eyeroll* No, not a satisfying conclusion at all.Also, I am not a person who is bothered by references to God and prayer but this author includes so many it is cloying. When you have annoyed a person who normally has no problem with it you know you've overdone it. "," But, I did enjoy watching Darcy and Lizzy fall in love.  Sometimes in Jane Austen variations, I get so frustrated when the characters are too stubborn and don’t communicate.  They almost crossed the line of being too stubborn here.This was a fairly/ moderately angsty tale with HEAs for most of the characters. "," What could be better than being loved by the Master of Pemberley? How about being pursued by his charming twin brother. But can Elizabeth put aside her prejudices and figure out which is the better brother? Set aside a few days to delve deep into Brenda Webb's latest P&P variation because if you've ever read her stories, this one is lengthy, juicy and filled with the brightest of heroes and the darkest of villians. Like a favorite mini-series, cozy up on your comfy blue sofa and indulge yourself. "," What an enjoyable experience I had spending time in this story. Had life permitted, I would have read all six hundred pages in a day. It's perhaps best, however, that I was forced to take breaks, for I'm already drained as it is. Such angst and anger for ODC! And such charges of emotion for this reader!Thank you ever so much for sharing this, Brenda. Your writing skills and your creativity are unsurpassed. "

Mrs. Bannerman, her father’s sister, has invited Elizabeth to spend a few months at their estate of Kingsdown, assisting her in preparing Elizabeth’s cousin, Louisa, for her introduction to society.Louisa’s father, initially resistant to the idea, sees his daughter blossom under Elizabeth's tutelage into a beautiful young girl, confident in herself and her place in the stratified society that is Regency England.When Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy, the Bannerman’s neighbor and Derbyshire’s wealthiest resident, she is impressed with his considerate nature. He seems ready to help whenever needed, without reservation. His sister Georgiana, however, is not as accepting, although she hides it well.Despite best intentions and hesitation on the part of both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, their friendship evolves into emotions more intense for both, leading him to hope that she might be the partner he has been seeking all his life.A vicious attack on Georgiana upends his plans and forces Elizabeth to leave Derbyshire under a cloud of suspicion, her reputation in tatters.The truth, when revealed, causes a massive shift in Mr. Darcy’s world, forcing him to re-evaluate his views and unfounded misconceptions. The fight to reclaim his lost love sends him to Longbourn, determined to prove himself again and overcome his love’s reticence to put her trust in him anew.  Read more","Colin Rowland is the brother of Jann Rowland, a well-known author in the realm of transformative works centered around Pride and Prejudice. Colin’s interest in the works of Jane Austen began with advice from Jann to read Pride and Prejudice. After having done so, Colin felt inspired by Austen’s work, and he now spends his free time penning manuscripts centered around the Regency England period. Such a genre has been a natural choice for him, for while he has always loved to read and enjoys almost every genre there is, his favorites delve into historical periods, from Ancient Rome to World War Two and everything in between.Though Colin has lived most of his life in Canada, he dislikes cold weather with a passion. This dislike led him to sell his house and move with his wife to the big island of Hawaii, where he loved every minute of the eighteen months they were there. Since returning to Canada, he has settled down in the small city of Medicine Hat, Alberta with his wife of forty-plus years. Together they are the proud parents of two sons and two daughters plus dearly loved grandchildren. They also act as servants to two dogs: a Shih Tzu, who has been with them since she was a puppy, and a Border Collie puppy he took in to ease the void caused when his former best friend, their senior Border Collie, crossed the Rainbow Bridge."," Elizabeth and Kitty visit her previously unknown fathers sister and her family in Derbyshire.  While there Elizabeth helps her two cousins learn about society and social behaviors that are appropriate for young gentlewomen.  Her uncle is particularly stubborn and rejects the idea that his daughters will marry well and see no need for the education Elizabeth provides.  It is during this visit Kitty grows and changes her attitude.Meanwhile Miss Georgiana Darcy is a real terror along with another young lady from the neighborhood.  They cause problems and when Georgiana is hurt in a disagreement rumors have accused Elizabeth as the culprit.  Darcy does not listen and refuses to have anything to with her family is she remains.Here’s my issue, when a family member tells you they have not done something and your own family was witness to an alibi- they should have stood by Elizabeth and refused to abide by Darcy his wishes.  They sent Elizabeth away and still remained in contact with Georgiana knowing Elizabeth was innocent.  My other problem is how Darcy handles everything.  I may have a modern approach to how things should have been handled but I didn’t like how Elizabeth was vilified in this story.  She was thrown out of bookstore with nasty words thrown at her and what happened to the bookstore owner… I don’t know it was not addressed.  The punishment for Georgiana seemed a bit weak.  I’m a don’t mess with my family kinda girl and Elizabeth’s aunt and uncle were to weak in my opinion.  So no five stars. "," I think there were a number of things about this story that left a lot of unanswered questions. In fact, parts of the story didn't really make sense to me; i.e. Georgianna is brutally assaulted and left for dead, but no one ever calls a magistrate to investigate? Instead the kangaroo court of public opinion is left to be the judge, jury and executioner with nothing more than scurrilous gossip against someone not from the county? That's insane. Also, when the real story finally comes out, the real attacker is sent to a private school? Really? Not jail or, at the very least, transportation?  The way Elizabeth reacts when accused is much too passive. Elizabeth is suppose to be a passionate woman who looks out for and defends those she loves, but she isn't very passionate about her own defense. It seemed like she just shrugged off the accusations and aftermath of events. It just rang false with me.  This could have been a good book but too much time was spent on extolling the glories of nature and walking instead of filling out the plot. "," The story has Darcy being prouder about his family and it’s name than in P&P. On top of that Georgiana has been spoiled by Darcy since his father died and is a cross between Lydia and Caroline Bingley.SPOILERSGeorgiana doesn’t warm up to Lizzy. G is attacked by one of her “friends “. When Darcy asks who did it G says Lizzy and Darcy won’t believe G has lied. Well you can imagine how Lizzy took that. She heads home to Longbourn. G finally tells Darcy the truth and he is off to apologize to Lizzy. During the apology Lizzy ask Darcy will promise to never do anything like that again and he says no. So when Lizzy forgives him anyway the whole sequence of events just makes no sense. So Lizzy and Darcy are a couple again and when they marry Lizzy has a Lydia/cpCaroline clone living with her. I certainly can’t believe in a HEA after that.Many unlikely occurrences happen in conversations during events to support the plot.  Thumbs down 👎. "," Elizabeth Bennet is enjoying Derbeyshire and her newfound cousins, the Bannermans. Elizabeth is determined to overcome the desertion of her almost-betrothed this past spring.  now, along with her sister Kitty, life is good.  new paths would be found, both literally and metaphorically.  new friendships, new horizons, new challenges - all would meet a crescendo.  and her life would change.  Elizabeth was accused of attacking Georgiana Darcy, a ""friend"" and sister to Fitzwilliam Darcy.  accusations and anger would rule the day.  Elizabeth would feel betrayal of the most acute kind.  her feelings for Fitzwilliam, now crushed, would sink her into despair.  to Longbourn she would return, her emotions in confusion.  would the truth ever come to light?  after two betrayals, would her heart ever be open to another friend or suitor?  this book was long and this Reader often grew impatient toward no resolution.  this is the ONE STORY in which I wish Elizabeth Bennet would just refuse this Darcy.  yes, that bad. "," Poor, poor Lizzy.  Suffering after losing a suitor to the lure of the sea, she visits relatives in Derbyshire.  Fitzwilliam Darcy is all friendliness and kind, while his sister is up to no good.I gave this story four stars for the times of over-introspection, and unnecessary repetition of events that already took place in the story.  While I did not appreciate how Lizzy was treated, that made for an interesting conflict for the lovers to overcome. "," Hmmmm not sure I was crazy about Elizabeth leaving under a cloud of shame. I also just don’t think Elizabeth would have caved and let him try to win her affections so easily after his heinous treatment.It was an interesting read but definitely not a top 10 variation. I’d skip if you’re looking for a riveting selection but if you’re just looking for a kindle unlimited book to while away a rainy afternoon, this is your book. "," This variation was a delight. I love the changes that were made. We have a slightly dislikable Darcy, a sullen mean Georgiana, and (largely) absent Fitzwilliam, a nice Miss Bingley. Elizabeth was more refined than others and the whole book seemed to draw more on gentel conduct than other variations. I can see why this might not be for everyone, but I enjoyed it immensely. Though I like the changes of the main story's characters they fell a bit flat to me. I didn't really care for them that much, and I felt the author could have done a bit more to flesh them out and make us care. Overall I would definitely recommend this story to others. "

HamiltonQuote from the book:  Elizabeth was not a typical light-eyed redhead, with spotty porcelain skin — though there were a few sun-kissed freckles on her perfectly shaped nose. Miss Bingley called her skin ‘brown’ and ‘coarse’ when it was actually golden — a bit exotic, even.Elizabeth Bennet has suffered all her life from being born a redhead — the only redhead in her immediate family or, indeed, in anyone’s memory of her extended family or ancestors.  The problem is not just that society favors blondes or that her mother favors the daughters who look most like herself.  Elizabeth is rejected at every turn by her father.So, when a gentleman, newly arrived in the neighborhood, refers to her with a “ginger” slur — carrot-headed chit, indeed — she is hurt beyond imagining.  And when he impulsively proposes to her — “if you can call a couple of sentences muttered from atop a horse a proposal” — she laughs. As Lydia would say, “What a joke!’’Often, it’s the deepest pain which empowers you to grow into your highest self. ~ Karen SalmansohnThat same gentleman, one Fitzwilliam Darcy, escapes from Meryton with his pride barely intact.  Darcy suffers from lack of sleep, too many responsibilities, and a general feeling of unwellness.Quote from the book:  Why could not the people in his life manage themselves? Why must he repeat to his aunt, again and again, a rejection so distasteful to her? Why could not Bingley heed the countless warnings already given him? Why should Miss Bingley look to him as her brother’s caretaker?Darcy cancels a visit to his Aunt Catherine and travels instead to Ramsgate to visit his sister.  Disaster!His sister is with his enemy, George Wickham, and planning an elopement.  In fury, Darcy turns red, staggers, and falls unconscious.  He awakens — how many days later? He has no idea — bound in a strange bed.  Unable to understand most speech and unable to speak without curse words, his doctor considers him insane.Trauma is a fact of life.  It does not, however, have to be a life sentence. ~ Peter A. LevineIn Darcy’s case, the trauma might well be a life sentence.  His relations have accepted the doctor’s diagnosis that Darcy is insane.  Unfortunately, that diagnosis fits in nicely with certain financial issues plaguing the Fitzwilliams.  Lady Catherine has her own agenda which could be fulfilled.When Elizabeth is banished from Longbourn after her refusal of the Collins’ proposal, she visits Ramsgate and re-enters the life of Fitzwilliam Darcy.The art of healing comes from nature and not from the physician.  Therefore, the physician must start from nature with an open mind. ~ ParacelsusElizabeth Bennet has always been interested in natural medicines.  She is able to aid both Georgiana and Fitzwilliam Darcy, but first, they must escape from those who keep them confined.Elizabeth also has a need for healing:  what will it take for her to stop wearing linen caps in an effort to hide her red hair?  Even Jane shows a lack from her upbringing.  Perfect Jane needs to heal too.If you like a lot of Darcy/Elizabeth page time, this is a book for you!  The story drew me in from the opening pages; the drama endured to the end.  I loved it!Healing is an art.It takes time.It takes practice.It takes love.~ Maza DohtaI received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review. "," I enjoy reading P&P variations so much!  This version was different from any that I’ve read before.  There’s plenty of struggles for both the H&h and sometimes the read is a struggle due to the tears shed.  This book needs Kleenex beside your chair!  The ending is happy, as usual, but some leftover struggle remains.  Just a side note:  I’ve never read a variation before with Mr. Bennet not having a closeness with Lizzy.  That, for me was hard to take.  I do recommend it as a good read to others who are a fan of P&P variations! "," I read the blurb and some reviews before I bought this book. I delayed a long time on the purchase, because I'm not a big fan of angst and melodrama. I don't want my JAFFs to be unrealistically saccharine, but life is tough enough without reading a depressing story.However, I finally bought it, and I am SO GLAD I did. Yes, it's a tough read – Darcy isn't the white knight hero, in fact he's the one who needs rescuing. What's done to him by his noble, well-connected family is terrible, but it's not hard to believe. There's all that lovely Pemberley money, and greed is an all-too-common sin that can strangle loyalty and affection.Elizabeth is the cuckoo in the Bennet family nest. She doesn't look like her father, nor her mother. Mr. Bennet suspects his wife of having had an affair during a troubled period in their marriage, and so he deliberately ignores Elizabeth, believing she is another man's natural child.The visit to Ramsgate is the setting for Darcy's attack of apoplexy. Georgiana is devastated, feeling powerless against Mrs. Younge's machinations and responsible for his illness. Darcy regains consciousness but is afflicted with what we now call Tourette Syndrome, where his speech comes out in the form of curses, garbling what he's trying to say. His relatives believe he has gone mad.We get an unflinching look at the cruelties inflicted upon patients during a time where medications were often more poisonous than curative, and the causes for illness were poorly understood and heavily debated among professionals, who were often barely educated and even more poorly trained.Visiting Ramsgate, Elizabeth is lonely, and struggles to help the young Miss Darcy, whom she met during a walk on the sea cliffs. She knows Darcy a little bit, having met him when Bingley was courting and marrying her sister Jane. But after he insulted her, she simply laughed at his later, impulsive proposal when he encountered her out walking. She believed he was merely making fun of her again.How Elizabeth manages to help Darcy makes for an absorbing and intense story. He must struggle painfully to get well, so he can once again take control of his life. His fate and Georgiana's, depend upon showing to all that he is **compos mentis** and physically hale.It's a rousing and satisfying finale. In the end for once our sympathies are all with Mrs. Bennet. Mr. Bennet, we discover, deserves no sympathy at all, from anyone. "," I think this author tells a story well. But this story was a little off the rails. Almost everyone is evil. If they’re not evil (Lizzy/Darcy/Georgiana) they are powerless or spineless.Mr Bennet is bad, Mrs. Bennet is bad, all the Darcy relations are bad. Even Jane was meh.Darcy’s stroke is a major plot line- although I appreciate that this author made more of an attempt than many would to depict aphasia accurately -it didn’t read true to my own experiences working in healthcare. I forced myself to suspend disbelief and moved on. Unfortunately turning Darcy into a weak and vulnerable character takes away a big part of his appeal. If he isn’t powerful and in control and an equal to Lizzy’s witty banter, why do we fall in love with him?Lizzy’s character is appealing. And I was engaged. I’m rounding my rating up to 4 stars because for all my complaints, I stayed up late finishing it and that tells me I should give the author more credit than I instinctively want to. "," Really enjoyed this P&P variation. While I mostly couldn’t put it down, there were some parts that dragged a bit. "

That she is set to marry her toadying cousin, Mr Collins, only makes the travesty worse. But what can he do?ELIZABETH BENNET DOES NOT wish to throw herself away on Mr Collins, but with the hedgerows looming ever closer, she has not much choice. When Mr Darcy arrives at Longbourn just in time to present her with an alternative, she has to ask herself—is he truly the last man in the world she could be prevailed upon to marry? Or is it Mr Collins? The answer is a simple, if surprising, one.HOWEVER A JILTED BRIDEGROOM is not so easily put aside, particularly not when it is Mr William Collins, and so Darcy and Elizabeth are required to flee to Scotland, taking the daring step of eloping together. With conflicted feelings between them and determined pursuers hard on their heels, the road to matrimony has never been bumpier but the happily ever after promises to be sweeter for it.  Read more","Mary Smythe is a homemaker living in South Carolina with a rather useless BA in English collecting dust in a closet somewhere. Mrs Smythe discovered the works of Jane Austen as a teenager thanks to the 1995 BBC Pride and Prejudice miniseries featuring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and has since gone on to read everything written by Ms Austen at least once yearly, always wishing that there were more. She has been writing since 2001, but only discovered Jane Austen Fanfiction in the summer of 2018. Mrs Smythe has two adorably precocious children, one girl and one boy, and a husband who bears a remarkable resemblance to Mr Bingley (sans the spinelessness). "," Whenever Elizabeth had previously indulged in girlish fantasies of her wedding day, she crafted a lovely image of it … Most importantly, the gentleman awaiting her at the end of the aisle — tall, broad, and darkly handsome — would be one whom she could love and respect in equal measure … The greatest tragedy, however, was the bridegroom; he was a man she could neither love nor respect in any measure … Elizabeth had even dreamt that another man, a secret admirer, might arrive on her doorstep and beg to take Mr. Collins’ place because he simply could not bear to think of her married to another.The quotes above set up the premise of this story:  Elizabeth Bennet’s father has not supported her refusal of the Rev. William Collins’ proposal and has insisted she marry the pastor.So, there she is, dawdling on the church steps, reluctant to enter and repeat her vows when, out of the blue, a carriage arrives at the church.  Her dreams come true!Well, not exactly true, but partially true.In life, it’s not where you go, it’s who you travel with. ~ Author UnknownCaroline Bingley, in a moment of stupidity, laughs at Elizabeth’s fate to her brother and Mr. Darcy, her intended (intended by Caroline at least). After weeks of debate, Darcy reaches an immediate decision.  He will travel at once to Meryton and propose marriage to Elizabeth Bennet!Quote from the book: Bingley hurried to keep up. “But why? Where are you going?”“Hertfordshire.”A second proposal is made; an acceptance is given; a blessing is received from the bride’s father.  Canceling the wedding creates its own issues, including Mr. Collins’ belief in the cradle betrothal agreed upon by the former Fitzwilliam sisters.The easiest solution resides in the carriage and a speedy trip north to wed in Scotland.Friendship is formed and turned into a stronger feeling as the journey progresses.  Quite a strong friendship, indeed.Pursuit by an enraged but still noble patroness and a jilted clergyman follows. Mr. Collins is clearly in over his head and suffers consequences.  Loved it!Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired. ~ Robert FrostI received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review. "," An interesting premise begins this roller coaster ride of emotional revelations and adventures. I was on the edge of my seat in anticipation of what would happen next. Another absolutely delightful story from the talented Mary Smythe. I enjoyed it very much. "," I read all the pride and prejudice variations when I run across them and this is definitely a favorite now. "," 4.5 stars. I have loved the previous offerings from Mary Smythe and knew I would also enjoy this book. The premise is an interesting one: what if Darcy decides to elope with Elizabeth? I'll be honest, at first I couldn't see that this would be plausible. Darcy would care too much about the repercussions. However, as the story progressed I could see how it may have worked.The story was fast-paced and many of our usual villains are here. Not only are these villains present, but many (Mr Collins and Lady Catherine) are in their vilest forms. I enjoy seeing these characters live up to (and maybe even exceed) our worst expectations.While I love a story where Elizabeth comes to understand Darcy better sooner, it almost seemed too quickly accomplished here. We all know he is a better option than Mr Collins, but I'm not sure she would so quickly be won to Darcy's side.Overall, if you're looking for an entertaining, unique take on Darcy and Elizabeth, go ahead and give this one a try. Who doesn't love a desperate Darcy?.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review. "," Not for the canon-character purist, but for the rest of us, this was a quick, fun, spicy read with several much-beloved tropes packed into it. Everyone is kicked up a few notches: Collins is extra the worst. Darcy is extra smoldering. Lady C is extra demanding, Elizabeth’s hair is extra unruly. Perfect light weekend read! "," The Netherfield party is gone and with it is Bennet’s hope for Jane making a match to save the family. Having been informed his heart is giving out, he imposes on Elizabeth to marry Collins despite how miserable her life will be.In London, it’s a good thing Caroline can’t wait to gloat over Elizabeth’s fall, as Darcy makes like superman and flies to rescue her.Thus begins a rush to Gretna Green. With some ups and downs the couple takes the travel time to learn about one another. Getting close and Elizabeth falling in love (rather quickly) there is vow anticipation, but it’s a fade out, so it’s all clean.Lady Catherine and Collins won’t go quietly and give chase.This is an adorable and quick read. It is not all fun and games, but it is a satisfactory romantic tale, with a feel good ending.MS is a solid author and offers enjoyable stories, which don’t disappoint.I received a free copy of this book for my honest review. "," Darcy hears that Elizabeth is to marry Mr. Collins the next day, and so he races back to Meryton to prevent the match.  I adored the scene in which Darcy meets Elizabeth for the first time since he left with the Bingleys.  It was swoon-worthy!  It doesn't take long for Elizabeth to decide that she would be better off with Darcy than the horrible Mr. Collins, who is truly mean and unlikable in this book.  Due to lies from Mr. Collins, and other circumstances, ODC find it necessary to elope to Scotland.  We are able to watch Elizabeth and Darcy come to know each other better, and work through some of their misunderstandings during their travels.  Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine continue to make trouble for Elizabeth and Darcy, but the two eventually reach their happily ever after!Ms. Smythe has done an excellent job with this book.  It was highly enjoyable.  I read it in under 24 hours because I could not put it down.  The book is very well written, and I did not see any errors.  I hope that she continues to write well thought out stories that engage the reader.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review. "

On advice from her aunt, she agrees to give the gentleman a second chance at making a first impression.  However, just as their relationship begins to blossom, danger threatens.

When Lydia takes an unplanned trip in the company of another gentleman, leaving Wickham and her children behind, he will be forced to face his fears and fight for those he holds dear.With the Colonel's HelpColonel Richard Fitzwilliam had only meant to improve Miss Elizabeth's opinion of his cousins, but, instead of lending aid, he inadvertently makes things worse. There is, of course, only one thing to do. He must confess his error to his cousin, for when a gentleman of honour creates a problem, he must see the trouble resolved.

Read more","Leenie Brown's heroes, when growing up, were authors, and the worlds they painted with words were (and still are) her favourite playgrounds! Now, as an adult, she spends much time in the regency world, playing with the characters from her favourite Jane Austen novels and those of her own creation.When she is not traipsing down a trail in an attempt to keep up with her imagination, Leenie resides in the beautiful province of Nova Scotia with her two sons and her very own Mr. Brown (a wonderful mix of all the best of Darcy, Bingley and Edmund with a healthy dose of the teasing Mr. Tilney and just a dash of the scolding Mr. Knightley).You can find Leenie on the web at www.leeniebrown.com."," Since I'm the proud owner of the majority of the books in this collection, I have decided to review  only the one part I  do not own, The  Oxford  Cottage . I will  review the others  separately they are all great reads.  The Oxford  Cottage  combines  a  sketch of the characters of  both Miss Elizabeth Bennet  and Mr. Fitzwilliam  Darcy.  This story also addresses how each deals with pressure due to the actions of our usual villain, Wickham.This is a side of the miscreant and his cohorts  we've not seen before.  I found I had to remind myself to breathe  a  few  times.  I'm sure you'll enjoy this story. "," The stories in this volume are about Pride and Prejudice characters in varied scenarios.  I enjoyed reading the stories, mostly.  I must confess that I found Through Every Storm to be farfetched and too soapboxy for Jane Austen fans.  As a Jane Austen fan myself, I have no interest in seeing these characters redeemed or rescued.127 "," It's difficult to review five stories in one book.  I'll just say, in general Leenie Brown is a talented storyteller and a good writer.  I found this collection to be extremely light fare, and not at all complicated or dramatic.  The stories are not related to each other, and each one explores one facet of a scenario based on P&P.  About the whole collection, I felt the tales were a little too simplistic, sort of like imagining a variation on a P&P situation in a perfect world.For example, the first story, Oxford Cottage, features a Mr. Bennett who is responsible and attentive to his family, including his wife.  He is buddies with the Earl of Matlock and Mr. Darcy senior, and they, along with Mr. Gardiner and Mr. Phillips, meet regularly and even discuss matchmaking among their children.  Everybody is respectable, intelligent, and successful.  No drama or problems.  It's a little too easy.Another story focuses on Lydia and Wickham years after their marriage that was thrown together by Darcy to save her reputation.  They have two young children, and Wickham has turned over a new leaf, is a responsible shop owner, and now loves his wife and wants to teach her to take responsibility for her actions instead of acting thoughtlessly and impulsively.  It's hard to accept that level of change in the villain, and he's being mentored by his friend Denny, who is married to a strangely wise and mature Kitty.  The whole concept just feels wrong.I know variations are meant to be different, but these stories all feel too easy, the characters are too perfect or too cooperative.  Although the writing is well done, the book left me flat. "," Each story could be a standalone piece, but together,  it was a page turner.  This shows a more gentle side of Elizabeth & Darcy.  Several change in character traits added to the.  enjoyment of the read.  Prepare to sit and enjoy yourself as you fall in love again with the P&P family!  Couldn't put it down. "," These are some of the very best variations I have ever read and I’ve read hundreds! I loved them. Such great characters and stories. Nothing was left wanting. Perfection! I’m getting some more. I have read this author before and really enjoy her. To have a collective is like JAFF heaven for me! Thank you!! "," This entire series of books is so good. I'm going to remove it from my Kindle unlimited to read more books but I can't wait to find it again and again later! "," An interesting collection of variations of author Jane Austen’s classic Pride and Prejudice. Several different storylines and character arcs but enjoyable "," I read and reviewed the three-part Oxford Cottage separately so will not review it here.26% For Peace of Mind: Wickham shots at Elizabeth’s young cousin, Andrew, when Elizabeth tells him to run in a bookshop and hits both.  Later he escapes captivity on the way to a ship and assaults Elizabeth but is crippled by her defense.  Pairing in this tale of Thad and Anne, Richard and Charlotte, Bingley and Jane, Darcy and Elizabeth, Mary and Collins.  Mary finds her voice.  Lady Anne is out-maneuvered when Anne marries before Darcy.  Matlocks approve of Elizabeth and it seems that Uncle Gardiner bought out Bingley’s father so Bingley’s wealth is partly due to Mr. Gardiner.  Gardiner has had business dealings with Matlock and Darcy before.  Bingley remained friends with Matlock.  Some wagers are made about who will propose to whom first and hints about who will have the first child.  Elizabeth confronts a disgruntled Lady Catherine and earns her respect.53% Listen To Your Heart: Anne finds paperwork from her dead father indicating his true wishes for her and the estate.  Anne confronts her mother about it and then sends Darcy to inform Elizabeth about the truth concerning their “engagement” but instead he has his “Hunsford proposal” moment and they argue…bitterly.  Both Anne and Richard know.Anne makes plans to move to the Dower Cottage to get away from her mother.However, this story soon develops into a story of Lady Catherine’s lost love, who turns out to be Bingley’s uncle. There is a lot of mystery involved with how her father, the previous Lord Matlock, forced her to marry as he wanted.  Late in the story we also learn just how.  We also learn of continued threats which involve a man seeking to win Anne’s hand as he desires an estate of his own.  He is not beyond planning murder and framing victims with treason.73% Through Every Storm: Lydia and George Wickam learns something about love with the help of Denny and his wife, Kitty.  Lydia learns George was paid to marry her.  George has fallen in love as he has turned himself around with a shop, two children and trying to repay Darcy for the money he paid to ensure their marriage happened.  But Lydia’s continued impulsive and selfish behaviors threaten the family’s respect and George’s peace of mind and his stability.85% With the Colonel's Help: This story begins just after the colonel has informed Elizabeth what a good friend Darcy is to his friends in the example of how he saved his friend, Bingley, from a marriage of unequal affections and one at the urging of the young lady’s mother.  Thus Richard has to make up for his gaffe.  He begins a campaign of guiding Darcy, even whispering in his ear, in the art of conversation and wooing a women while at the same time giving information about Wickham, etc. to Elizabeth.  It is information which she accepts more readily from him than he suspects she would have from Darcy.  Then we come upon a variation: Darcy and the Colonel have offered and then arranged to have Elizabeth and Maria travel with them back to London.  Who do they come upon while approaching London but Lydia…disheveled and with some wounds and obviously in distress.  They take her with them to London and hear her tale as to why she is in that state.  Lydia sickens and Mr. Bennet arrives.  Most of the rest of the story has to do with Mr. Bennet and Mr. Darcy at odds over Darcy’s “acquaintance” with the Bennet family.  The Biblical parable about “casting the first stone” comes into play here as the Colonel continues to help Darcy. "

E.R. Bennet asked reasonable questions in a well-crafted letter. Traveling to the area to stay with a friend, Darcy is eager to make the acquaintance of the despondent landowner.Neither Miss Elizabeth Bennet nor Mr. Darcy is what the other expected.

Intrigued by the many possibilities, she began developing her own story for Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. At the time she wrote her first novel, ""A Father's Sins"", she was living high in the Andes Mountains of South America. Joy loved to take an occasional break from the Latin culture and bury herself in reading English literature about her favorite English characters. Joy, and her husband of 37 years, lived next door to their only child, Jennifer, her husband, and twin grandchildren and is a native Oregonian.In late 2014 the Kings relocated to Oregon where other stories popped into her head. She is typing as fast as she can to keep up."," That simple gesture told him how invested she was in the produce of the land. His mind turned to all she stood to lose if her father died.Her feet are solidly planted on good Hertfordshire soil.Those sentences appear fairly late in this story, but for me, they sum up the point of the book.I freely admit to being a farmer’s daughter.  My early memories involve herding cows and packing lunch to take to Dad in the field. I walked through wheat fields nearly as tall as I was until I learned not to do that after the wheat began to head. I swam in the stock tank and walked to country school.  I related very strongly to Elizabeth’s efforts to save Longbourn as long as she possibly could — which of course, would be only as long as her father lived.By the end of the book, the chorus of “Oklahoma” ran through my mind.  It was still there the following morning.  It is time for it to leave now!The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts. ~ Margaret MitchellWhen Mr. Bennet falls ill, the Bennets’ Uncle Phillips and their neighbors who might have been expected to offer support to the family choose a different path.  Uncle Phillips sides with the heir apparent.  Sir William Lucas gives no aid to the family.  Elizabeth Bennet takes on the responsibility of Longbourn.  Her Aunt Gardiner knows the Darcy family by reputation and suggests Elizabeth contact Mr. Darcy to ask for advice.  Since it is inappropriate for a woman to correspond with a man, she signs her missives as “E. R. Bennet” to conceal her identity.Never, in her wildest dreams, does she imagine that someday Mr. Darcy will accompany his friend to Meryton.Darcy arrives in Meryton hoping to meet the young E. R. Bennet.  At the Assembly, he learns the Bennets have five daughters and no sons.  Darcy does not deal well with deception.And yet, his sister hopes he will meet “the woman of his dreams” during the visit.A person does not grow from the ground like a vine or a tree, one is not part of a plot of land. Mankind has legs so it can wander. ~ Roman PayneThe Bennets know they must relocate soon.  Can they trust the help offered by their new neighbors?Quote from the book:  “Papa, the man has been both arrogant and kind. In matters of society, I would ignore him for the rest of my life. In matters of the estate, I trust him implicitly. Aunt Gardiner was correct. He knows his business well.”In the midst of this chaos, our dear couple must find time to fall in love.But a more mature love must also be expressed.Quote from the book:  However, it was a small wooden box in the back of her husband’s closet that finally reconciled the mistress of Longbourn with how their lives were soon to change permanently. Inside were silly verses she had written to her husband after they were first married. She sobbed.“Mr. Bennet has always loved the written word.”An abundance of JAFF stories feature the differences and unhappiness in the Bennet marriage.  For a welcome change, this is a story of Mrs. Bennet’s grief at Mr. Bennet’s death.  Mama Bennet and all the Bennet daughters mourn and accept.  I felt every fear and let loose a few tears. Beautifully written.The author gave me an early copy of this book without requiring a review.We come and go, but the land is always here. And the people who love it and understand it are the people who own it — for a little while. ~ Willa Cather "," This book brings out the best in our beloved characters at the worst of times.  Their challenges and efforts to defeat them are well displayed as they surmount their difficulties by  strength ing their best values.  It is a very enjoyable read. "," I enjoyed this book very much.  By pulling together and listening to the wise counsel of Darcy , Elizabeth Bennett is able to provide for her family in spite of the situation. "," This story caught my attention from the first page. In a thoroughly interesting concept, Elizabeth has the opportunity to know Darcy's character before meeting him. Sad circumstances but lovely tale. "," How am I going to do this story justice without spoilers?  You will know from the blurb that Mr Bennet is gravely ill and doesn’t have long to survive.  That Elizabeth Bennet has written Mr Darcy by recommendation from her Aunt Gardiner, using only her initials. Elizabeth finds herself in charge of holding her family and their home and estate together, without ever being involved in the running of such before.  She’s in need of advice from a respected and knowledgeable landowner because no one else has helped.  From the first knowledge of Mr Bennet’s illness the leaches in the surrounding area have oozed out of the woodwork. Even formerly trusted friends and neighbors and, the worst, family.Elizabeth’s courage has indeed had to rise in the many attempts to discourage (and obtain her comparative wealth, her body, the use or disposal of her family) her.  It’s appalling and stomach turning.Darcy’s written advice is taken to heart and implemented with precious little help.  But with success.When Darcy first finds out E R Bennet is Elizabeth Rose Bennet he is furious for being deceived thinking another woman trying to trick him into marriage.  Yet after witnessing her responses in several public situations he has multiple talks with himselfIt’s a great setup for the rest of the wonderful story.  Darcy is so heroic in this story I fell in love with him more than I have in a very long time.  Elizabeth’s courage is so remarkable in this tale.  I even loved Mrs Bennet.As for the villains in this story,  Caroline Bingley’s snakes and toads flowing from her mouth are a 10 rating.  Wow.  But the Bennet sisters’ Aunt and Uncle Phillips take the prize for the most venal relatives you would ever not want to meet.  Oh my.  My stomach clenched so much I should have tighter abs now.I cried so much in the last third of the book I gave myself a headache.  But such a beautiful story with all that angst.  This one I will reread many times. The writing is so good. The dialogues that go on inside Elizabeth’s and Darcy’s minds are richer than the spoken words due to the privacy of thoughts and continued self discovery, and of course the social practices of the times.  But through that we see them both grow in important ways that influence their outward actions.  In my mind all show and no tell is often frustrating and incongruous.  We only witness the outer change in the other characters.  The focus was on Darcy and Elizabeth.I highly recommended this to Austenesque fans but I think it worked well as a Regency clean Romance too. "," I admit I cried a bit, and that is one of the marks of a good author. To so stir your emotions that you feel what they want you to feel. The storyline was excellent, and the Regency information supplied at the end was rather fascinating.Darcy and Georgiana's relationship was previous and everything I love seeing between them. Darcy and Elizabeth's relationship progression was just lovely. Not really any angst between them, which is always refreshing, but also just how their experiences changed how they thought about the other. And how Lizzy thought about Wickham for the brief moment that he might have mattered. And especially how Darcy goes from being angered and betrayed that she's talking with Wickham to how he ultimately sees that situation. I enjoy these two using their brains, and they definitely so that here. Also, way to step up and be counted for the whole of the Bennet clan, but especially Lizzy and Mrs Bennet. "," Wonderful weaving of Darcy’s visit to Neatherfield with demise of Mr Bennet. Thw relationship with Darcy  and  Elizabeth so realistic. Evevn zMrs Bennet is attractive character. "

There they are introduced to Mr William Mackeby, the Viscount's son, Mr Darcy, and Mr Bingley beforehand the re-enactment of the legend of Horatio Buckthorn escaping from a bear.  The Viscount looks forward to this fair every year, but first participants are picked for the reenactment. Speeches are given, and the person with the most points is Horatio, the least points is the bear. Bingley thinks this would be fun so he enters the contest. Darcy is mortified. Lizzy teases him for being too stiff, proper, and proud. In this reenactment Bingley is the bear. Oh yeah, he gets to wear the costume of different animal skins sown together. Lizzy tells Darcy that his friend enjoys the ridiculous. Darcy is so enraptured with her wit, beauty, knowledge that he wants to loosen some of those straight laces to win her approval. He picks Georgiana from Ramsgate, and all the young ladies become friends: Marie, Lizzy, Jane, Georgiana, and Jemima, the Viscount's daughter and form the Buckthorn Green Ladies Club. While the girls are walking the beach, wicked Wickham arrives and Georgiana introduces him to Lizzy. Lizzy is suspicious of their relationship. She becomes concerned when Georgiana asks her not to say anything about George to her brother. Jane slips up and Georgiana tells William about what's been going on during her time at Ramsgate. Her companion is let go and Wickham is confronted and a commission is purchased by Darcy. A letter from Charlotte indicate that Lydia's behavior has become a disgrace and if not stopped will ruin the Bennets. Both Jane and Lizzy write home to their father, mother, Kitty, and Lydia. Lydia's return letter is disgusting. When Wickham is mentioned, Darcy is off to Longbourn. Lydia is saved, Wickham threatened then punched, but Darcy leaves Longbourn wondering how Lizzy and Jane are related to this ridiculous family. Battles with himself all the way back to Buckthorn Green. Ridiculous wins out with Darcy filling in for Bingley's bear debut. HEA for three loving couples. Hilarious results when Mrs Bennet meets Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Loved this Darcy even though it was so out of character. "," The novel remains true to the characters of the original P&P, but puts them in a delightfully different situation.  Basically they are all thrown together at a local historic festival.  The novel focuses on Lizzy's tendency to judge too quickly and Darcy's strong need for dignity.  Which isn't exactly what our original Darcy struggled with but boiled down to something similar enough to the original P&P. I'd call this a light hearted book with little angst, it is very clean.  It was a nice variation, not the very best variation. But still a pleasant way to spend a few hours with our beloved Lizzy and Darcy. "," The Buckhorn Green Festival is totally and completely silly.  Who could dream such a thing up?  Well a good writer can and if you let yourself go with it all, it is a fun story full of crazy ideas, like the jam festival, but it is all good fun.  I liked the book and accepted the idea from which it came.  I would just as soon as fun as not.  This was a good story to read just before Christmas and I think you may like it too.  We are all different and some of us don't like fun and crazy ideas, like Mr Darcy.  But then some of us do. "," This is my third book by this author.  Again, well plotted, highly creative with in depth characterizations.  In 2 out of the 3 books, however, I just do not care for how Elizabeth is written. In this one, she again comes off as too quick to judge and is written with no ability to temper her prejudices.  In some of her attitudes here surrounding Georgianna and Wickham she seems to have no clue at all that a 15 year old girl being approached by a man could in any way be harmful.  The author has Elizabeth judge Darcy far too harshly without any thought to his concerns or reasons. "," Ms Langley takes the canonical characters and drops them into an imaginary country festival heralding the victor of a certain Mr. Buckthorn over a hapless bear.  As my son-in-law would offer... Shenanigans ensue.  Darcy drags Bingley's to Buckthorn Green where our favorite ginger promptly begins to fall for the angelic Jane.  Sparks fly as the ever proper (can we suggest too proper and dignified?) Darcy rubs up against an effervescent Lizzie.  Reverend Campbell offers the reader an insightful explanation into the reasons for his reserve.  I found this ultimately more logical than the canon. Georgiana and Lydia are both saved from Wickham's foul plots, although he is simply vanished from the story in the end.  Sadly, the unnecessary disgrace of Mrs. Annesley left me feeling a bit off.  What not keep Mrs. Younge in the role. 4.5 Stars overall. "," ODC meets under different circumstances away from Hertfordshire.Elizabeth has her usual prejudices about a man who seems to have no sense of the ridiculous (and the Horatio Buckthorn Festival is ridiculous!)  But ODG recalls an earlier time in her life (the Mary Clemens affair) when she made a hasty judgment.Darcy shows his usual pride but acknowledges his attraction.  But what will happen when he meets the Bennet family?This is a low-angst account although Wickham, Lydia and briefly Lady Catherine enter the picture.Although I prefer a little more conflict in JAFF, I did like this story. "," This story was very sweet. It was a nice what-if since any Jane Austen fan could tell that, had Darcy met and spent time with Elizabeth before encountering her family, he would have definitely behaved differently. This story story showed that difference. I enjoyed it. "," A fun read. I liked this story a lot. The character development was done well. I really liked the ending. Just funny and sweet. "

By far, however, the thing she loves most is the connections she has made with readers and other writers in various forums! Amy currently lives in Myrtle Beach with her husband and daughters, as well as three Jack Russell terriers who often make appearances (in a human form) in her books."," I was reading long past the time I should have been asleep. This book is absorbing and very interesting. Brava Ms. D'Orazio! "," I have read so many JA variations, and usually found lacking.This book delivers! Plenty of variation while staying true to the period and characters.Look forward to reading more from this author. "," Another wonderful reading experience from this author.  She's become an automatic purchase when I see her name as the author.  The story begins during Elizabeth's visit to Netherfield to nurse her sister Jane.  Caroline Bingley attempts a compromise of Darcy, and he's confronted with a demand by Bingley that he marry his sister.  In desperation, Darcy states that he cannot marry Caroline because he's engaged to Elizabeth.  Darcy quickly approaches Elizabeth and informs her that they must marry.  Of course Elizabeth refuses, since she doesn't like Darcy at all.  But she changes her mind when Mr Collins proposes, and Mr Bennett starts to insist that she accept him. She agrees to become engaged to Darcy, as it's the lesser of two evils.Although this isn't a completely new idea, the writing is so exceptional, the characters portrayed in such a wonderfully engaging manner that it all feels fresh and creative.  It's such a pleasure to read books created by smart and clever writers, and Amy D'Orazio is one such. The story is imbued with a healthy amount of humor, but also with enough drama to keep it interesting.  Darcy is portrayed as endearingly clueless to the wishes of those around him, especially at the beginning, and Elizabeth is ceaselessly kind and compassionate, even while gritting her teeth in exasperation when Darcy acts like a blockhead.  Their journey to HEA is fraught, but it's also so sweet and romantic.  This is a swoon worthy Darcy, and an extremely lovable Elizabeth.The enjoyable surprise of the story is Viscount Saye,  older brother of Colonel Fitzwilliam.  He's a fabulous character, and his dialogue is hilarious. He's the one who always  says exactly what he wants, and hang propriety.  I fell in love with him, and he has a major impact on the story.The usual villains appear in the story, and get their comeuppances.  There's a very interesting twist on one of the villains that has quite the profound impact on many others.  The book is well written and well edited.  I only wished that the book lasted longer, and that's always a good sign.  I can't wait for her next creation.  I recommend it highly. "," Good story with plot twists. Darcy and Elizabeth characters vastly different it is highly unlikely as per their characters in original but still the story is enjoyable. All other characters introduced were delightful to read also. "," I feel this is one of Ms. Amy D'Orazio's best stories. The set-up for Darcy and Elizabeth agreeing to marry one another as ""the best of a bad situation"" is creatively handled, with ODC attracted to one another, yet also at odds because they are still virtual strangers to one another.Her creation of Viscount Saye as a new Darcy cousin is simply brilliant. There is no other word for it - he is Darcy's opposite in almost every way, and yet the bond of affection between them is just as strong as it is between Darcy and Saye's younger brother Colonel Richard Fitzwilliam. It's amusing to see Elizabeth helping Saye's romance, even as Saye helps Darcy's romance.Jane develops a backbone and a more realistic attitude, both improvements in what is a sweet but somewhat vapid Austen character.An engaging and fun read, and well worth the purchase by all Austen fans. Highly recommended. "," Don't pause, read further, just get it. This is a truly wonderful book, best JAFF I've read in a while. Not going to include spoilers here as you'll want to go in blind and just savor all of it.Amy D'Orazio has quickly become one of my favorite go to JAFF authors for consistent, well written, entertaining and lively stories. The trope might be typical but she always seems to write creative variations with twists that surprisingly I have not seen before and I've read a lot of variations.Her sense of humor is fantastic, her creation of Lord Saye is the secret sauce. A wickedly, laugh out loud funny, scene stealing character. While a minor P&P character, Ms. Amy developed him into a engaging secondary character who is not just there for laughs (though there are plenty) but he also assists in moving the plot along.  He has all the delicious traits that make so much sense and provides so much freedom in writing him given his wealth, title and position.Then we get to ODC, just the right amount of angst, indecision, misunderstandings, redemption, and romance to make the story believable and enjoyable.Thoroughly satisfying read, thank you Ms. Amy! "," The witty dialogue, the usual misapprehensions, and the marital ambitions of Mrs. Bennet are all delightfully interwoven in Mrs. D'Orazio's newest tale. The story unfolds when Darcy and Elizabeth are confronted with a disastrous future in their marriage partners. This time it is Caroline Bingley and Mr. Collins who wreak havoc on the inhabitants of Longbourn and Netherfield Park. The plot has many twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the end. But this is not the most engaging part of the book. Mrs. D'Orazio continues to unveil the best secondary character in her writing, that of Viscount Saye, first born son and brother to Colonel Fitzwilliam. The dinner party scene when Elizabeth Bennet meets the Matlock family isworthy of a Regency screenplay for its comedic repartee. A part of the book deals with Georgiana after Ramsgate. It shows the versatility of Our Darling Author as she addresses the more serious topics of women's emotions in coming to terms with unhealthy relationships. Count on losing some sleep as you will not want to put this book down until it is done. "

We are plopped down in Darcy’s bedroom on the first page (Read the Sample) and (not for young, innocent eyes) read of his hung-over interpretation concerning the condition of his bed sheets.As we again read how each misunderstand and confuse actual events and meanings in conversation, so also Mr. Bennet, and even our dear Mr. Gardiner, are dumbfounded when certain young men confess their sins.  And then, as other reviews have said, there is that sermon about how our thoughts are as sinful as the actual act.  Read how Elizabeth now has 6 young men going to her father and wanting her hand.  Seriously?!I have read a number of novels recently with “Compromise” as the premise.  But in this one you ponder, “When is a compromise, not a compromise?”  Do you agree with the preacher?  This one plays out with so much humor.  Bingley and Jane surprise us.  And we find incidents of eavesdropping which lead to more confusion and misinterpretation.  Remember how we are warned about that fault.  Caroline Bingley, Mr. Collins, and to some degree, Lady Catherine, play roles not completely as in canon – oh, dear, NO…not at all.  In this novel we even have a discussion with several doctors leading to misconstruing of physical allowances.  What a web.So we have compromise, arranged and re-arranged marriages, delays in coming together and surprises. Darcy is a changed man as he accepts fait accompli in this situation.  His mind dwells on “pleasures” and he enjoys using that word to make all things right in his concepts of happenings.  Elizabeth is persuaded to accept his hand and then she begins to appreciate this man as he is now open about his feelings.During the early library scene and later at Pemberley a song is shared and bantered about.  I had to look it up on the Internet to listen to it.  The words Darcy sings are different but, then, he did assert that his words were those sung in Derbyshire.  Here is the link: The Ash Grovehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TIvM02DroII enjoyed this and for the most part it is a clean novel but for those first pages. "," I really debated over 3 or 4 stars, but, 3.5?This premise had wonderful possibilities, but,It really felt as if there were at least 2 different authors here. Most of the first half of the book were off and on again, quite juvenile, while during the last half, Darcy and Elizabeth were having some very deep philosophical discussions.Overall, I did enjoy more than I didn’t, though I did do some skimming through. "," - Love the characters.- Darcy and Elizabeth are on good terms early.- Plenty of D&E- Held my interest.- Very little of Caroline, Lady Catherine, Collins, and Wickham. "," Except there is no seduction. Darcy wakes up after a drunken fantasy, in his mind, night and there are all sorts of clues that he seduced Lizzie. So he does the right thing and offers marriage.Lizzie isn’t seduced so she thinks the offer is because he loves her, which he does. His being forced by his honor makes him happy because now he has a legitimate reason to marry her.The rest of the book about the ramifications of this misunderstanding. Funny in places, angst in places, confusion by other in places.Will the marriage happen? Will she love him? Will everything get straightened out?I recommend this book. "," I enjoyed this book, and if ever a story needed a little spice but didn't deliver, this is it. in fact the whole book alluded to something spicy and then, nothing.  Just like E & D's wedding night.  Nadda, zip, zilch - nothing.  ""Sweet tea"" fans will love it, and it's appropriate for all ages.  Like I said, I enjoyed the book, but it was a tease. For me, it was a (relatively, considering the fact that it's fan-fiction) well-written let down, but that's no reason to say it's not a good book or for a bad review-- I just doubt I'll chose to pay for any other works by this author. "," Oh Mr Darcy!!! You thought so wrong. What happened was totally innocent, but not in his mind. Trying to do the right by the woman who captured his mind and heart, Mr Darcy does try very hard. Elizabeth accepts, but is a little confused on why he asked. Through a humorous storyline find out the why and how the true love shows itself. Highly recommended for all to read "," Talk about a misunderstanding (misconception?) dragging out for a long, long, time. I didn't think it was possible, but the author did pull it off--at the price of making Darcy endearingly flaky. He comes to the wrong conclusion initailly and then makes everything that happens fit into it..The book is almost humorous, but the romance is sweet and believable. Elizabeth's love for Fitzwilliam develops slowly but surely. Even if she's sometimes perplexed by his actions (or lack thereof) she comes to know the kind and considerate man he is and understand why he's the way he is. It is a very enjoyable voyage of discovery for our two main characters and a book I will certainly enjoy reading again. "," This was an enjoyable read with all the characters seemly making good solid marriages, with some sexual heat added.  It's funny what a good sermon can do in a small church to make the men suddenly all desire marriage to avoid sinning.  My only complaint with this book was a desire for more angst, I love some evil in a book and missed it in this one.  But a nice variation that was read in one sitting. "

Enjoy :D"," 3.5 rounded up to 4 starsAs Rose said in her review...you have to accept that Elizabeth would leave Longbourn and with the help of the Gardiners travel to Lambton in order to search for employment as a companion or governess. She explains her reasons in part later in the book as being able to support herself since she wants to marry for love is a necessity.Ironically she accepts an offer from the mother of a girl she finds talking to two boys and whom she then diverts away from the boys and makes friends with, offering to share a meat pie with her as they walk through Lambton. It is only after she has accepted the offer that she learns the woman is Mrs. Darcy, second wife to Fitzwilliam Darcy. When she then explains that she and Mr. Darcy did not get along very well in Hertfordshire, Mrs. Darcy states that he stays away from Pemberley and thus he will not be a problem. Elizabeth has lied about her background, claiming to be a widow, Mrs. Wilson.Part of this story has to do with a gang of highwaymen who have created havoc with carriages traveling in that area of Derbyshire. Darcy and his cousin, the Colonel return to Pemberley determined to bring these men to justice and thus, when he meets Elizabeth her lies are exposed.Elizabeth is forgiven and soon finds that she considers her charge, Rose, as much a friend as a pupil. The Colonel is charmed by her and asks Darcy if he has any interest in Elizabeth soon as to not overstep if he wants to court her. Darcy discourages the Colonel but does not give any reasons other than the facts that she brings nothing to a marriage, money or connections.Of course, Elizabeth gets to see a side of Darcy which is in contrast to the character he presented in Hertfordshire. Darcy has not enlightened her about Wickham so she still cannot figure out the contradictions in his behavior. Darcy learns about his mistaken impression of Jane and sends a letter to Bingley without Elizabeth's knowledge.Elizabeth has not communicated what she has been doing to Jane (or her family) so when some events (I'm not revealing) have Jane traveling with the Gardiners to Derbyshire once again Elizabeth has some explaining to do. Jane is then the one to be giving advice to her younger sister.This was a pleasant story. There have been other stories in which Elizabeth becomes a governess but it is usually for Georgiana. Darcy's relationship with his stepmother has some adjustments to be made in this story also. "," To start, I really liked this book, despite the waffling 3.5 rating. I was interested throughout and enjoyed the little tidbits of desire that flared up between ODC from time to time. it was a clean variation, but not prudish; the author allows the characters to feel physical attraction even if they appropriately restrain themselves (well... mostly. There are still clandestine kisses in the dark).My real stumbling blocks are the premise and Darcy's occasionally harsh responses to Elizabeth. As to the former, I thought that the concept of Elizabeth becoming a governess was fine, yet her reasons for doing so weren't well thought out. She claims that she does so in order to free herself from the obligation of being mercenary in her husband hunt, hoping that this will essentially help her to form a more pure connection untainted by money since she can now provide for herself, yet by becoming a governess she has lowered her status and made herself unsuitable as a bride in the Gentry class. Unless she hopes to meet/cute a nice footman, she has quite severely limited her options and practically ensured her own spinsterhood. And, according to Elizabeth herself, she's completely aware of her own fall in status as she takes on a new identity and travels accross England to spare her family the shame of it. Additionally, she states that she has an ""allotment"" of 5,000 upon marriage, which she specified wouldn't be shared amongst her mother and other sisters, so she wasn't all that bad off to begin with. Much better financial prospects than in the original. So...why did she do this, again? I want to accept her reasoning, but I'm still scratching my head over it. I can understand her running away from her mother, Mr Collins or simply wanting autonomy with no intentions to marry, but not the motivation ascribed here.As to the latter issue with Darcy, I found him rather harsh at times and wondered why Elizabeth was falling in love with him at all. When he first arrived at Pemberley, after having previously met her in Hertfordshire, he exposes her true identity and orders her from the house immediately. Okay, I guess I can see him panicking, but he later reminds her harshly of ""her place"" and calls her a servant, both behind her back and to her face, several times. And after their very sweet, romantic kiss in the dark...he simply says they'll never speak of it again and she runs crying from the room. He has redeeming moments, too, but any one of those incidents would have had me hiding under the bed and/or packing my bags. Maybe I'm too sensitive? Their ultimate revelation of feelings was anticlimactic after all that.Oh, and some relatively minor flaws in grammar, punctuation, repetition, etc. Also, in one instance a character's name changes from Will to Luke, I think.Still really liked a lot of elements -- highwaymen, rivalry between Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam, Rose was endearingly spoiled, etc -- but I'm still confused. Will likely reread t a later date to see if I understand it better, lolz. I liked her other novel, Mr Darcy's Cipher, better. "

She needs an editor pretty badly and there is A LOT of graphic adult content here, but it was really good, if you're into that. When it comes to adult content, I rate it based on if it made my tummy flip reading it. I know that sounds silly, but there are so many not good sensual scenes in the world of P&P variations, it is a reliable way of measuring, for me. Lots of tummy flips. Most of her writing isn't like this, btw..but it's all so close to being great that I will continue reading what she puts out. It's always original and interesting! "," The author states that Elizabeth becomes “uncompromised”, which is kind of like becoming “unpregnant”, so I am pretty sure she meant compromised.  To avoid marrying Mr. Collins, Jane agrees to a plan to basically trap Mr. Bingley in marriage.  When Mr. Darcy arrives instead of Bingley, Jane backs out.  Elizabeth, fearing she will be next in line for Mr. Collins’ attentions, jumps in to take Janes place and finds herself married to Mr. Darcy.  Slowly, they begin to build a real marriage, but what will happen when Darcy learns of Elizabeth’s deception?  The story is fairly bare bones, with descriptive sexual scenes.  Not particularly well written with a tendency toward more modern speech.  The story could be about almost anyone with almost no actual pride or prejudice, but with Austen’s character names, and a couple of similar situations such as Lydia running off with Wickham.  Forgettable read. "," I think this is a 2.5 star book but I rounded up because it had some good moments.This is not Jane Austen’s P&P world in many ways. Pemberley is only 50 miles away from Meryton. Mrs. Richards is the house keeper, not Mrs. Reynolds. Lizzy can’t play the piano much at all but Jane plays at the normal Lizzy’s level. Lizzy will compromise Darcy so she doesn’t have to marry Collins. A few smaller things also.But all these changes don’t impact the story much so it’s mildly off-putting but not too distracting. Writing is pretty simple.But the story has a few original twists so it’s not a bad, quick read.I recommend the book to those who can check it out with Zkindle Unlimited. "," Sexy and cute. I enjoyed reading it. Not the most deep or believable but the end got a lot better. "," Story started with the Bennet sisters scheme to compromise CB but ended with FD. FD married EB, then the married life, the LB' situation then FD and EB/ED situation.There were lots of error, grammatically and choice of words. Some reactions doesn't make sense and I thought the ending felicity felt rushed. There's also a lot of love scenes but I guess it goes with the (title) story.Nevertheless, the story was simple and different. It kept my interest to finish it. I still recommend it to P &P fans. "," Okay, uncompromised is not the correct term. It should have been they were compromised. This drove me crazy. Otherwise, a bit of an easy go but not bad. "," SPOILERS:  Elizabeth deliberately compromises Darcy and everything spirals out into bizarro world after that.  Elizabeth character is written as if she is Georgianna’s age.  Darcy is afraid of his Aunt Catherine and fearful that he may have had to marry Anne or ??? Ms Bingley?? (for no other reason given than Ms Bingley wants to marry him).  Most of the usual key figures make no appearance at all. The majority of the story seems to be descriptive sex taking place in one bedroom or another.  Not a keeper for me. Glad I read it through Kindle Unlimited. "," This was an interesting variation. The story was not 100% clean, but that made it even better. I loved how Jane and Elizabeth had a little bad girl vibe going. They did what needed to be done. Darcy was intense no !matter the mood. Highly recommended to read "

What his late father had decided to keep from him, threatens to ruin Mr Darcy’s life forever.“The Darcy Secret” by Kelly Miller is a real treat for Jane Austen fans. Although I do believe that the original “Pride and Prejudice” is perfect in every way, I’ve always wanted more interactions and dialogue between Lizzy and Darcy. And that is what Ms Miller generously provides in her elegant Austenesque variations. Keeping her stories true to the Regency era norms and societal limitations, the author adds a bit of spice and edge to the plot to make the books interesting for modern readers.In “The Darcy Secret” we get to see more of Georgiana Darcy. Moreover, it is unclear until almost the end of the book if she is who we’ve been used to believe she was. There are some dark secrets lurking in the past of this innocent and shy girl, who was always in the shadow of her elder brother. I liked this plotline since it kept me musing about Miss Darcy’s true character. Besides, by portraying Georgiana’s struggles with adjusting her behaviour to meet the expectations of others, the author has raised important questions about the influence of that era’s rules’ rigidity on an individual.“The Darcy Secret” offers everything that we love about Austenesque romance variations. It is beautifully written, full of lovely Lizzy and Darcy scenes, and on top of that, it tickles the readers’ nerves with unexpected mysteries and shocking revelations.

That plotline just distracted me from Georgiana’s possible mental illness.I also thought the story’s climax came a little too early.In spite of these issues, I enjoyed this story and recommend it to anyone who likes JAFF.That which you mistake for madness is but an overacuteness of the senses. ~ Edgar Allan Poe "," I enjoyed the story but I am not sure that the title was appropriate.

Rather short sentences, very little introspection.  Everything that happens is rather abrupt. "," Unique perspective dealing with mental illness in the storyline. I don't normally enjoy an author's personal crusade, but fortunately the author used a light hand in dealing with this issue. The extra characters were a nice touch and dealing with Lydia's eccentricity was well played. "," An unusual premise and a gripping tale grab your attention in this excellent variation inspired by Jane Austen’s classic novel Pride and Prejudice. I enjoyed it immensely. "," This was dark at times. I liked the unity between E&D. The resolution was somewhat easy, and there were many things breezed by with time jumps or scenes not being written. The Powells played heavy and then disappeared, Lady Marchand, children's births and family reactions to then, and even Georgiana's issues were never explained and her evolution was vaguely mentioned in an abbreviated epilogue.It was decently written but not my preference.

Yet they do meet, and to her astonishment, he holds no resentment towards her. Regrettably, someone else does. Unbeknownst to Elizabeth, her reintroduction to the master of Pemberley is far from universally welcomed. There are others for whom prejudice is stirred up by the familiarity between Miss Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy.Darcy is amazed to find Miss Bennet at his house, her opinion of him altered materially for the better. He is busy making plans to renew his attentions to her when other impediments arise that threaten to undermine his hopes of happiness. Will problems with house and household crumble the tender foundation between them before they can build a life together?UNFOUNDED is a second chance romance at Pemberley and is a novel length Pride and Prejudice variation.  Read more","Serious word junkie, steadfast purveyor of silliness, and author of historical romances in the Austenesque and Regency genres. Does all her writing in the garden shed, which is nicknamed 'The Hermitage' and boasts a vintage chaise-longue, a view of the Hertfordshire countryside, and a wooden parrot."," Pemberley was hers. Every chamber, every passageway, every stair; each and every nook — from the attic rafters to the cellar floor — were embossed upon her mind. The house was in her blood. Indeed, there was no small quantity of her blood in the house, for one could not scrub properly without scraped knuckles to show for it, and not even the lofty rank of housekeeper had exempted Mrs. Reynolds from scouring her share of grates and flag stones over the years. Her home, her livelihood, her world for the last quarter of a century — Pemberley had earned an unassailable place in her heart.What an important opening paragraph! Without knowing the place Pemberley holds in her heart, we would never be able to understand Mrs. Reynolds’ actions.Further, we next learn: There was but one entity to which she was more devoted, and he was arriving on the morrow, bringing a large party of friends and his younger sister with him.Now we know everything we need to know about Mrs. Reynolds: she loves Pemberley and gives her life to its upkeep; she devotes her life to keeping her young master from harm.In a restless heart, the seed of betrayal lay. ~ Bruce SpringsteenAmid the chaos of an approaching house party and aware of her own approaching death, Mrs. Reynolds must accompany an unknown threesome on a tour of her home. Without an introduction, she customarily assigns a nickname to guests of this sort.  The older woman: Daffodil. Her husband: Tea Caddy.And their niece: A younger lady accompanied them, and the eyes with which she unblinkingly surveyed her surroundings were so dark and so wide, and framed with such startlingly long lashes, as instantly put Mrs. Reynolds in mind of Clarabelle the dairy cow.Mrs. Reynolds learns the ladies are acquainted with the scoundrel, George Wickham! The young woman even knows her master, Mr. Darcy! Why would she tour the house unless she were out to trap the master?  Mrs. Reynolds is on alert to all possibilities.Yet, the master arrives early and spends time with the visitors. He introduces his sister to them. He invites them to dinner.Mrs. Reynolds must take steps to protect Mr. Darcy and Pemberley.The saddest thing about betrayal is that it never comes from your enemies. ~ Author UnknownDarcy’s devastation when he learns of the betrayal is proportional to the love he received and gave to his housekeeper all his life. What an important, although unacknowledged, relationship he had with the woman!The story of Darcy’s crumbling respect for his longtime housekeeper is intertwined with another serious crumbling: Walls of the east wing of Pemberley itself develop cracks.  How far does the damage extend?  Why now, after hundreds of years, does the deterioration appear? How can the foundations be fortified? Are repairs even possible?“Unfounded” is a unique story, strongly told, and includes a scene invoking memories of “It’s a Wonderful Life.”Quote from the book: After the upheaval of the last few days, Darcy did not much feel like exerting himself, but in the end, he was required to do nothing more than talk to people. It was not the sort of conversation he despised — the sort that passed around dinner tables and ballrooms and obliged a person to appear interested in the concerns of strangers. On the contrary, every person to whom he spoke had a memory of Pemberley to share with him, and that was a topic on which he could happily converse indefinitely.Jessie Lewis is self-acclaimed as a lover of words.  “Unfounded” demonstrates that love.Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three. ~ Ziad K. AbdelnourI received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review. "," This is one of the most brilliant P&P variants I've read, and so far I've probably read well over 700+ over the last five years. Mrs. Reynolds (housekeepers were always referred to as Mrs., even if they had never married) has only a few scenes in Austen's P&P, with no background given except that she has been at Pemberley a long time.Yet every JA fan feels they know her immediately, and agree that it is her words of praise regarding Mr. Darcy that strengthen Elizabeth's acknowledgement of her love for a man she completely misunderstood.This story posits that unlike canon, Elizabeth makes a very bad impression upon Mrs. Reynolds during the tour of Pemberley. Just as Darcy misinterpreted Elizabeth's dislike of him, Mrs. Reynolds mistakes the mention of Wickham and believes the young lady is another conniving fortune-hunter. The irony makes one smile, but the story quickly turns serious: aware of her own mortality, determined to protect Pemberley and its master, Mrs. Reynolds, reluctantly but intentionally, actively interferes between the two.Two subplots weave through the ODC romantic mishaps, adding tension and humor. The tension comes when the existence of Pemberley itself is threatened. Can anything be done, when no one can find a cause? The humor comes from an exchange of letters between Mrs. Reynolds and her best friend, wherein they exchange anecdotes about what is happening in their lives, using pseudonyms so that the people they are discussing will remain anonymous to the other letter writer.The romance is well-written and satisfying. The insertion of Lady Catherine as both infuriating and helpful, is creative and completely in line with her character's traits as noted in canon. Darcy's strengths and real weaknesses are vividly drawn, and a number of scenes show how well Elizabeth's strengths complement her husband's.The wrap-up was a bit short for my taste – no mention of the physical changes needed outside? How did Darcy manage the considerable expenditures necessary, especially in view of Georgiana's dowry requiring disbursement of such a large sum?However, despite those minor loose ends, the HEA is there. The writing is top-notch, the editing was professional, and the story unique. Highly recommended! "

(4 stars it needed editing) "," Needs serious editing but is otherwise a good story. I didn't really like the way every problematic person was simply sent away somewhere. I would have liked more of them to try an attitude adjustment. I don't think that so many people are incalcetrant.  Most of us are capable of change after negative consequences bring our attention to the problems. "," A good story with low angst.  My rating is really a 3.5 due to much repetition.  In one passage, the same information was repeated three times.  There are also a few typos and the wrong name was used. Some editing would be helpful.

"," Enjoyable variation. Interesting storyline that deviates from the original, but retains all the players- good,  bad, or indifferent. This is a saga that encompasses all the Bennet/Darcy family and extended family members making it quite involved. My biggest concern was repetition of phases/paragraphs. There were also some typos, but mostly it was repeating thoughts that become old because they don't advance the story only drag it out. "," An absolutely delightful and very entertaining variation inspired by Jane Austen’s classic novel Pride and Prejudice by Melissa Anne. I hope she continues writing more lovely stories. "," Angst free, yet filled with love and heartbreak.  I always enjoy a reformed Lydia before she causes true damage with a Mrs Bennet being stopped from  ruining the chances of her daughters.  I enjoy it when Darcy knows what he wants from the start, although I prefer that he be less pushy about it.  It always saddens me when Mr Bennet breaks Lizzie's heart though. "

Even Lady Catherine wasn't quite so obnoxious as usual, and Elizabeth's handling of her was hilarious. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was personal - I just did not care for Mr. Bennet in this story. It was logical, but personally abhorrent - 'there's no fool like an old fool', I guess. And especially the callous acceptance of being cuckolded - ugh. "," A wonderful story filled with shocking and more shocking happenings that floated around certain members the Bennet family. While visiting Charlotte at the Hunsford parsonage, Elizabeth is reacquainted with Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy and meets his illustrious relatives Lady Catherine, Anne, and Colonel Fitzwilliam. This story opens with Elizabeth trying to beg off going to dinner at Rosings that afternoon just having heard from Colonel Fitzwilliam that Darcy Darcy helped separate Jane from Bingley. While at dinner, an express arrives for both Elizabeth and Charlotte that they are needed back in Meryton because their parent (s) have taken sick and may not live.

Telling her mother that she will, Darcy steps into Mrs. Bennet's viewing range, and proposes to Elizabeth. Just having promised her mother's dying wish to marry the first rich man that offered for her hand, Elizabeth accepts.

Characters are true to cannon but Elizabeth’s character is enhanced. More Hope than angst in this plot that I have not read elsewhere. "," This is another entry in the ""Lizzy and/or the Bennets is/are actually nobility/rich"" variation. I liked some of Lizzy's new attributes, especially the retentive memory trait. Unfortunately it's very hard to write Darcy as a hero when he's so arrogant in his superiority, but eventually becomes not just embarrassed, but humiliated by his misassumptions about the woman he loves.It's a tricky line for an author to balance on, and Ms. Speck doesn't quite pull it off. Darcy's jealousy is understandable but his continuing insecurity after discovering Who She Really Is, makes him seem more unnerved and uncertain than we're accustomed to, even after they're betrothed. Lizzy constantly assures him of her undying love and loyalty every time they're together, but he doesn't seem to trust in it. It's odd, and a stumbling Darcy is not the confident Master of Pemberley of canon.There are few errata, but the two I found are very noticeable. It's my understanding that banns must be called in the parish (not the shire) where one resides or attends, so on page 113, Elizabeth should have told her Godmother that ""... the third banns were read in Longbourn AND Lambton (or wherever the parish the Darcys attend when at home)"", in order for ODC to be married at Pemberley.Another was ""... the number of guests who will DAWN upon your home, Miss Darcy"" on pg 125 - I think Ms. Speck probably meant ""descend""?Except for those two instances, the story was creative and the pacing was good. It was fun to see a more assertive, competent Elizabeth Bennet/Lady Lavinia. I just would have liked an equally competent and strong Darcy to match, but YMMV. "," It seems there are reviews here on Amazon under the title Elizabeth's Deception that are meant for another ""version"" listed as Growing Pains by the same author. The latter it seems is not a good story from the negative reviews as they mention comments about inclusion of pedophilia and lesbianism (??) which are not at all part of the storyline of Elizabeth's Deception.  Perhaps a technical issue on the site?Anyway, Elizabeth's Deception is a pretty decent story about our Lizzy Bennet not really being a Bennet daughter but a cousin of rather high rank hiding out incognito from unknown bad guys for reasons I won't spoil here. Not as much a P&P variation as an alternative story with the old and some new characters.It's a creative story but could be improved with some careful editing and attention to dialog that doesn't make E&D sound like they are in a high school drama. There's a nice mystery, lots of antagonists, some are the usual, some are not.  The writing and characterizations are not deep or sophisticated, the heroine is somehow impossibly perfect, vengeful and lovable while the hero is at turns proud, haughty, overly jealous, insecure and sappy.This a pleasant, quick mystery for a light leisurely evening, just take it for what it is. "," This had so much promise and potential to be a truly great and memorable variation.  The premise that Elizabeth Bennet was in fact a true Lady of noble birth and one who is superior to Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, if not for the deception she had to play for protection, is a remarkable one not many JAFF authors have delved in the past.  The emphasis on women empowerment is also a huge factor in giving notice to this variation (Georgiana got over her heartache of Wickham most satisfactorily).  What is so off about this variation, which warrants the two-star deduction, requires a recital of the problematic elements:  the lack of proprieties committed by the characters; the boorish way the men talk, joke or treat the ladies; the hasty (which could be even described as sudden) realization by EB (for all her intelligence and cautiousness) of her love for FD; and the way proud Mr. Darcy easily succumbs to the demands of EB (even to the extent of allowing her to engaged in spying for King and country while with child) just because she has more wealth than he has (which I find quite ridiculous). Also, the author, although with a good mind to make up such a plausible variation to mesh with the original P&P, made a mess with the meshing with so many inconsistencies that she is left with having to explain them all throughout the book when they could been avoided all along.  This is still an enjoyable and novel read however. "," I do wonder if sopha is a real alternate spelling for sofa, but other than that, and a surfeit of ANDs... This is a wonderful variation! Here again, Elizabeth is in hiding. This time because the one who murdered her father, a marquess, thinks she or her brother have the key to a fortune in gold.She didn't know that she had the key until the very end but the ride along the way is amazing. In her pretence as a Bennet, she is given the backstory of being the 'natural' (read illegitimate) child of Mr Bennet. How would the good folks of Hertfordshire accept such a lady? What about the supposed wronged lady who is his wife? Because Mrs Bennet understood Elizabeth's origins and the reasons for the deception, she readily accepted her husband's supposed indiscretion and opened the way for others in the neighbourhood to do likewise.The pretentious Mr Collins, Miss Bingley, and even Mr Darcy in the beginning, are recipients of her well-rounded and internationally educated tongue. There is the awful Kent proposal and Bingley's defection and the spectre of uncertainty while trying to figure out who killed the marquess. Well written and edited. Well worth it! "," This was a fun, quick read that stayed interesting throughout the book. The mystery was an unusual piece in JAFF. Uh this author made it work. The book was lighthearted and the characters were quite likable.  Actually, I would have enjoyed the same story in a longer book with more character and plot development. "

Read more","Discover more of the author’s books, see similar authors, read author blogs and more"," SPOILERS!This is one of my favorite ""abduction"" stories. I have a fondness for the villains when they are very bad-even though some call it overdone or too dramatic, these characters when written well have the potential to be pretty horrible. And I like when a writer leans into that in a realistic way. The only story I got a little bored of was Anne DeBourgh. It was not unsurprising for her to be so manic, I just wish her storyline had been done with quicker. But it was not bad! As for the ""good guys"", I really liked the entire family of the Duke and the Raleighs. Also being fond of P&P variations that have politics or historical events mixed in (I wish there were more!), this made me want the story to go on! That is my only real complaint, that it stopped too soon. This book is well worth the read, and I would love to see more from this author! "," I have really mixed feelings about this book. The premise isn't a new one, but sounded like it would be entertaining and thrilling. I'd read part of the first chapter on a blog somewhere and liked what I saw. The beginning started out okay. We know from the get go that Matlock and Lady Catherine are not going to make things easy. The Prologue shows a conversation between the two that is overheard by Lady Matlock. We get to see priggish and proud Darcy, and are left to some conjecture about how he ended up that way.Things I liked:-I always like a great story about Elizabeth not being a Bennet. This one had a convincing tale about HOW Lizzy came to be a Bennet.-Jane had more backbone-Mary was close with Lizzy and Jane-Some character growthNow, for the issues that had me scratching my head.1. It bounced around. A lot. Frequently I had 2 or 3 paragraphs on someone's storyline before it bounced to another view point. A lot of the time, the new story line had NOTHING to do with the one we were just reading. For example, we would read about Anne de Bourgh doing stuff, and then it would jump clear to Elizabeth and Darcy doing something completely unrelated. The bouncing around detracted from my enjoyment of the story and made my head hurt.2. The author would frequently allude to something and then not explain it for awhile. This wasn't just a story hint. These were things that left me going ""huh? that makes no sense"" and then they'd be patched up later on. For example SPOILER ALERTLouisa Hurst is alluded to messing with John Locus at the beginning of the book. Later on, it says she's pregnant. Then, when she goes into labor, she tells Caroline the baby is too early to be her husband's. Wait, what?? They're married! How can that make sense? Have they only been married for a little bit? Fast forward. After bouncing around a couple other story lines, we are back to Bingley getting a letter that Louisa and the baby died. They try to find Hurst and can't for awhile. Then suddenly, Bingley is saying that Hurst won't accept Louisa being buried in his family vault. Apparently, Bingley had come across Hurst in an unguarded moment some time ago and he outlined his conjugal habits to Bingley, so that he apparently knew without a doubt that Louisa's baby was not his. This whole discourse felt patched up and left me feeling jarred and unsatisfied.3. Throw away characters. Random characters suddenly showing up without previous mention. Example: Anne de Bourgh's companion Miss Younge. There is virtually no mention of her at all until she is shown eavesdropping on Anne's husband. These characters often felt like they were were created on a whim to forward the plot.4. Story lines that felt rushed, unresolved, or lacking in detail. There were a lot of these. Wickham, for example. His story line ends abruptly and feels like it wasn't really needed as part of the plot. Other rushed story lines include Julian's with the Russian Princess (grand duchess?), Matlock and the Viscount, Julian's work with the home office (we get NO back story on that, so we're left guessing a lot), and a lot of Elizabeth's experiences with Franny Bennet. Elizabeth's experiences for SURE were glossed over. There was no showing how it shaped her and not a ton on how it effected her later on.Unresolved: the first Lady Matlock. Thing one: Her eavesdropping on Lady Cat and Matlock in the prologue. NOTHING comes of that. Thing 2: She FAINTS when she see's Elizabeth. It is ASSUMED that she contacts the Northhampton's afterward, but a) HOW did she recognize Elizabeth? b) What happened after she fainted? c) where the HECK did she disappear to after Matlock and the viscount were out of the picture?Also Unresolved: Delaboix. Um...he just sort of vanishes. They set him up as this crime lord and then he just melts away. What?How quickly Darcy and Lizzy came together also felt not quite believable. Darcy in love with Lizzy after seeing her twice? Lizzy forgiving his extreme insult so fast?Basically, the story structure needs help. there are great bones here, excellent even. But the bouncing around makes it really hard to follow. "," I'm unsure. I did not dislike this. The middle definitely dragged. The epilogue was--maybe not morose but--less than upbeat. With the length of E&D's attachment, it would have been nice to see their relationship progress more. The side stories became too much of the focus, and the outcomes of most of the villains were too easily achieved. I really did not dislike this novel, but I'm not sure that I can claim to like. Maybe, it was ""tolerable."" "," Overall, this book is exceptionally well written and will appeal to the majority of JAFF readers. It has its flaws, but is well worth reading regardless.Pros:Again, exceptionally well written. It flows smoothly, the characters are fleshed out, the plot has no obvious holes, and so on. This is a high quality work with almost no technical errors at all. It's also very detailed and creative, though I've seen the same concept of Elizabeth being abducted and later adopted by the Bennets before. This rendition is unique to itself in a lot of ways.Cons: though the characters are fleshed out, I still felt like they were a little cliche at times. The protagonists and their entourage were essentially perfect and always agreed with one another, the villains were unrepentantly evil and rather maniacally so. Seemed a little simplistic to have good and bad in black/white terms. Also, this story is packed with drama, a bit much for my tastes. Each angsty plot element was well crafted, I just felt like there were a few too many of them. The latter criticism is strictly my personal opinion and others will likely not feel the same.I recommend heartily in spite of my complaints. The positives far outweigh the negatives. "," Yes, it's another abduction variation, if you didn't get that from the title. This one fleshes out the lives of many characters. The Fitzwilliams are somewhat one dimensional: just plain evil, even poor put upon Colonel Fitzwilliam doesn't escape his upbringing and is therefore less likeable.The backstory allows you to know a kindly Mr Bennet finds a beaten, frightened Elizabeth as a five year old and takes her home to raise and love her alongside his daughter, Jane. When his wife dies, he invites his brother, Thomas, and his wife, Frances, to come live with him to help raise his two girls. Then he dies and this Mrs Bennet is nothing like her predecessor.When Jane marries Mr Bingley, Elizabeth is taken to London to live with the first Mrs Bennet's sister and her husband, Admiral and Mrs Raleigh. She is 'found' but still in danger so must be protected from the evil, scheming Fitzwilliam family, especially Lady Catherine de Bourgh.Lots of sadness and some madness makes this a very intriguing story. Few grammatical errors, though not flawless, make this easier to read than many P&P variations. "," I liked the book overall. I did feel like it was stretched out a bit with little side stories that weren't really necessary. The last 1/4 of the book probably could have been half the length but if you like details of the villains in the book and how things went for them, I was just ready for a wedding and Epiloque without a villian.

Hard to review as by getting into particulars, could ruin the surprises for the reader.Thanks to the author for the generous gift of a bonus story. Loved it! Sometimes a novella creates power by using a circular approach.  The story was moving, compelling and so many emotions canvassed in a shorter work that gave it strength. Fast start with a slow and steady plotline, excellent period details, good characters and a happily-ever-after ending with a jolt. "," A rather interesting and unusual premise in this variation inspired by author Jane Austen’s classic novel Pride and Prejudice by Jessica Jackson. An enjoyable story. "," Initially, I found this a bit confusing, but the more I read the better it became. It has some awkward wording for a Regency  romance, some of it being from  an earlier era, some from I'm not sure what era, wrong words regardless of the era, and too much slang for any era. I premise as good, so the plot was thought through, but when writing a P&P variation, it's best to stick with the Regency era, making it somewhat disappointing. Some things had quite a lot of detail and other places, less than needed. It was written as low angst, so not much character development happened for our favorite characters as they were too agreeable. Overall, Interesting read. "," Great premise.  I would have liked to learn more about Aunty and  the Power history.  Did not care for the outcome at all.  Bad guys needed much paper punishment. "," The story was terribly underdeveloped, you could easily guess what was happening, and it was not really very good. I was disappointed because most of the story was left unexplained and I am not sure that the explanation would have made it any better. "," First of all, I have to say I almost stopped reading before the story even started, because a quote from Macbeth was attributed to Hamlet, complete with mention of act and scene as if the quote’s origin had actually been checked. I thought “how can a book be any good if the author and editors don’t even notice such a basic error?”I forged on, however, and the writing was much better and cleaner than such a mistake suggested. There’s a mystery at the heart of this story, tied with a bit of the supernatural, and it made for a good tale, with all the pieces falling into place at the right times and all of the plot points coming together. However, for me, there was still something missing. There was little sense of danger or urgency regarding the mystery (and the supernatural element), and a shallowness to the emotions that seemingly everyone felt. I felt like I was told there was danger but I wasn’t convinced that anyone in the story actually felt it.But that might be a personal response so others might get more out of this story than I did. "," Plenty of mystery and suspense as Wickham finds a villain to assist him and Darcy has hidden talents. Lizzy is immune to persuasion from the bad guys BECAUSE she is an obstinate, strong minded woman and a few non-canon characters add spice to the story. Not so find of the extra short story, but ""Trouble"" is very well done! "," What a great quote to open this spooky little story.I am not up to date on supernatural powers and I had issues understanding just what power Fitzwilliam Darcy possessed in this story; especially because Mr. Collins has the same power.Mr. Collins is very out of character to his canon image as well as his fanon image.  I have rarely seen an attractive Rev. Collins, but even with his good looks, Elizabeth Bennet is somehow suspicious. What is his intent?A young boy seeks a lost cricket ball and comes across a mystery.  How is the old barn connected to Longbourn?I was a bit confused by the ultimate comeuppance for the villain of the piece. I also would have liked to know what power Darcy’s valet has.In spite of my confusion, I did enjoy this story very much.The shadows of familiar things about him stalked like ghosts through the haunted chambers of his soul ... ~ Henry Wadsworth Longfellow "

It gave me several hearty laughs and disposed of the villains handily, leading to joy for all remaining.  Yes, the writing caused this old English teacher to make several dozen corrective notes, some for grammar (epidemic comma splices, confusion of tenses and cases, confused constructions, as ""you have found someone who you care what they think of you""); some for pretentious and inept word choices (use of ""shall"" with second or third persons, modern American ""mad"" for angry, ""the entire party dismissed,"" ""a smile diffused so rapidly across her face,"" ""tried to ensconce with Georgiana last summer,"" ""over the years at charity aides and fundraising events,"" ""since the banns were posted in The Times,"" and many others); confusion over parts of speech and homonyms (loathe as adjective, rights for rites, reined for reigned, aide as verb); and many (I hope) misprints: extra or missing letters, omitted words, redundant words (""each separated to his respective room"").  And many more.  Bearable for very careless readers or the partially literate. If this is the second edition, how unreadable must the first have been? "," I've been making my way through just about every P&P variation, sequel etc for two solid years. I LOVED this book. It was so delightful. I loved the lack of strong tension between Darcy and Elizabeth. The plot twist regarding the Bennet's financial situation was unexpected. The Lady Catherine bit was somewhat unbelievable, but I didn't care. I was enchanted by this version of Darcy and Elizabeth and Jane and Bingley. I also liked that Mr.Bennet was not the callously uninvolved father that he was portrayed as in a few of the books I read. The background surrounding his coming to be the Master of Longbourn was an added feature missing in other versions. I was glad there wasn't all the sex that seems to be so prevalent in many other versions as well. I'd highly recommend this book for anyone who, like me, can see the variations as what they are- just romances involving characters we already know, and for people who love the comfort that brings. "," I have read many P&P variations lately and I would rate this one slightly above average. I feel like it started out very promising, but then I started losing interest about half way through the book. The author puts a completely unique and interesting spin on the Elizabeth and Darcy story.Darcy quickly becomes smitten with Elizabeth, but keeps insulting her on accident. After a particularly disastrous evening, Darcy removes himself to the library where he is overheard mumbling (by Mr Bennett) about how bad he treated Elizabeth. Mr Bennett then gives Darcy some information about the family and tries to explain Elizabeth's personality to Darcy. However, Darcy does not know he is speaking with Elizabeth's father.Mr Bennett knows that his daughter will eventually fall in love and want to get married. He wants to makes sure she makes a match based on love, and to ensure that she marries someone worthy of her. As he gets to know Darcy, he becomes rather fond of him and gives him information on how to obtain her good opinion. Darcy and Elizabeth finally start getting on track and there is a funny moment once Darcy realizes that his source is actually Mr Bennett.The best scene in my opinion is the ball at Bingley's. I don't want to give too much information away, but this is the best ball scene I have ever read in any P&P variation. It's interesting, sweet, and funny (in a heartwarming way). It's here that the plot thickens and Wickham tries to sabotage the couple's happiness. However, the Wickham issue comes to a head fairly early on in the story and then the rest of the story seemed to consist of Elizabeth and Jane shopping for their wedding trousseau.Overall, this was a good read. I don't regret reading it, but I do wish that the author would have drawn the Wickham plot out longer, or added some more tender love scenes. Darcy tells his beloved a few times about how he can't wait to make her his wife, and show her the Master's apartment. But once the couple gets married, it ends here for the most part. I wish the author would have added a tasteful love scene here (I know not everyone wishes this though). "," This book is a nice P&P variation for those not looking for strong sexual references. The variation from the original story comes in two main points. First, Darcy acknowledges his feelings for Elizabeth really early in the story to none other than Mr. Bennet who plays an anonymous matchmaker. And second, their is really minimal friction between Darcy and Elizabeth so you shouldn't count on any Pride nor any Prejudice to spill from the pages. The tale ends up being about young lovers and the anticipation of marriage. There are very few character alterations which is always pleasant in a variation. Mr. Bennet comes off as a smart and involved father. Lady Catherine and Caroline become more villanous but get justice served to them in public and humilating ways. All in all, the story is charming and if you can overlook lots of editing mistakes, it's worth a rainy day read. "," I liked this story, even though I don't think that the storyline is entirely plausible, with either Mr. Bennet or Lady Catherine.  Rest assured that the usual villains have page time.  Among atypical scenes between Darcy and Elizabeth, there were scenes of lightheartedness that brought a smile.  I particularly liked the interaction between the Lady Matlock and Mrs. Gardiner, which was refreshing, but probably not realistic of this time period. Except for some conversations that were too contrived, it was an enjoyable enough read. As an avid Pride and Prejudice fan continually in search of a P&P sequel, ""what if"" or retelling, the absence of so much angst in the relationship was welcomed.  Please note that there are errors, particularly with spacing. "

It shows a more vulnerable Darcy who, buoyed by Elizabeth, his family, and his friends, struggles to acknowledge that his worth as a man is not based solely on his material possessions.  There was plenty of angst and uncertainty with Elizabeth as the true hero of the story. For me, the only downside was the ending, which was rushed and unfulfilling.

Hats off to anyone who puts in the effort it takes to write and publish.That being said, this tale has great bones-- but needs more fleshing out.  I would've liked more conflict & misunderstandings between ODC; between Elizabeth & Wickham, and Wickham/Darcy.  More thought process of characters figuring themselves & others out.  More dialog that went beyond polite exchanges, and expressed the unique voice and personality of each character.  Additional info on HOW Elizabeth created her fortune.A small quibble:  it's not at all clear WHEN Elizabeth finds out her carefully concealed wealth has been outed by her mother. I kept expecting more of a kerfuffle over that throughout the story.Ms Jensen, I sincerely have no wish to offend. Please keep writing. Your plots are intriguing. I very much enjoyed your earlier JAFF. Eager to give you 5 ***** "," While this is a decent story with less angst than the original or most adaptations it still needs some work. Throughout the story are numerous spelling errors that are  reoccurring and its obvious that proofreading wasn't done.  Story was actually good until the point where Darcy proposed and Elizabeth accepts...then its a rush to get the story finished as though the writer was running out of either time or available words. It's absolutely unsatisfying for the reader. "," A rather lovely and enjoyable short story inspired by author Jane Austen’s classic novel Pride and Prejudice by Kate Jensen. "," This short and sweet variation was a fun low angst  read. I enjoyed it as a relaxing story at the end of the day "," Enjoyed it "

We are then given several chapters from Peacocks of Pemberley.I did enjoy this story. Longbourn burns.I think one of my favorite events is that Mr. Bennet is shocked into making an about-face in his behaviors. This after not only having an entire wing of Longbourn burn down but also almost losing his wife and Mary in the blaze. Both of the latter are saved due to Mary's heroics although she and her mother are seriously injured. Bennet's entire library with its books is lost, also.As the blaze erupts one of Longbourn's men is sent into Meryton to recruit help to quench the fire. Darcy hears the shouts for help and becomes a hero as he not only rushes to aid but also organizes the bucket line and directs the wetting down of walls and the removal of paintings and artifacts, etc.Bingley offers Netherfield's unused hunting lodge as a residence into which Mary, Kitty and Mrs. Bennet move. Mr. Bennet and the other three sisters stay at Longbourn trying to organize and restock the household. Fortunately, there is the summer kitchen which is detached from the main house, so they are able to have food prepared to sustain them.Obviously, Darcy now is looked upon with much more respect by the Bennets and the entire community.Bingley shows some backbone and Caroline reaps well-earned consequences. Lydia surprises us. First, I must say that as the family decides she was responsible for the fire she is now Mrs. Bennet's scape goat. She also learns quickly that the family cannot afford new wardrobes to replace what was lost in the fire. And she takes steps trying to earn her way back into favor. That plan is almost disastrous! Not only to Lydia but to several others.I have perhaps given too many hints about the threads in this story but there is so much more going on that you really need to read it for yourself. There is an epilogue, which I always enjoy. "," I have every one of the P&P variants Ms. Kendig has written, and she is one of the few authors whose books I will automatically purchase pre-publication. She has such creative and interesting P&P stories, and unlike many fanfic writers, seems to have no trouble keeping the personalities of Austen's iconic characters recognizable. When the characters change their behavior, it is for justifiable reasons, clearly explained without needing an excess of detail or melodrama.I make this point as this story has a subplot of Lydia finally maturing. She must face some very unpleasant truths, and her painful awakening is beautifully handled. It isn't easy to admit her selfish and careless behaviors have terrible consequences for the people she loves. Her steps to redeem herself are halting and only partially successful, for like Elizabeth she has a decided independent streak. Ms. Kendig makes the reader cheer Lydia on - no small feat, as I'm normally in the ""a very little or no Lydia is fine with me"" camp!The epilogue consists of three short chapters, so we get a look into the next ten years or so into the lives of the Bennet family as they go their separate ways. "," The story begins after Elizabeth's stay at Netherfield nursing Jane. The very day that Jane, Elizabeth and Lydia are in Meryton being introduced to the new militia recruit, Mr Wickham, they receive word that Longbourn is on fire. The fire destroys an entire wing of the mansion, and results in changes for everyone in the Bennett family. Lydia goes from being her mother's favorite to being reviled as the person whose recklessness caused the fire. Mary Bennett goes from being the most ignored daughter to being hailed as a heroine for her courage during the blaze. Mr Bennett has a wakeup call after almost losing a wife and daughter in the fire, and he sheds his lazy and indolent ways. Jane and Elizabeth are forced to economize, and to enforce budgets on their mother and sisters. Kitty becomes the caretaker and comforter of her mother. The daughters all learn to have a much more active role in the chores and management of the household.Darcy has a major role during and after the fire, and this is definitely a swoon worthy Darcy. He is, however, still fighting his strong attraction to Elizabeth. Elizabeth thinks Darcy is too proud, but she hasn't yet been poisoned against him by Wickham's lies. When she learns what a vital role Darcy played in saving Longbourn from much worse damage, she begins to change her attitude, and comes quickly to esteem him. Bingley is given more backbone in this version, and his dealings with Caroline are superb.There are some nice little dramas in the story that make things interesting. As usual with this author, there are a fair amount of religious references, but not enough to get preachy. The profound changes to the Bennett family are satisfying, as are the ways that the usual villains are dealt with. The book is well written and well edited. I recommend it highly. "," Tragedy strikes the Bennet family in this P&P variation.  A horrendous fire almost destroys Longbourn mansion.  This story explores how the characters react in the face of adversity and how they respond in a crisis.  Four of the Bennet daughters are in Meryton  when it happens.  Mary Bennet is at  home and in act of heroism saves her mother and herself.  Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley are in Meryton as well.  When they hear about the fire Mr. Darcy takes charge of the situation.  Because of him much of Longbourn is saved.  The story progresses from there as Longbourn is being rebuilt.  There is much going on between our beloved and not so beloved characters.  There is other dramas at play which result in a crime.  Along the way there are HEA'S and some minor characters are given a voice.  All in all an enjoyable read. "

Author","None","Y","6.99","10,977","2023-05-01","574","4.0","314","What would have happened if Jane had been born male?James Bennet is the perfect heir to Longbourn. He is always looking out for his sisters and mother, making sure they have the opportunity to receive proper education, and always making sure they have the guidance and direction they need. He purchased a small cottage to ensure that his mother and sisters had somewhere to live in the event that something happened to him and his father. He works tirelessly on the estate to ensure that Longbourn is profitable. He puts any additional money that comes into the estate towards ensuring that his sisters have dowries that are appropriate for their social standing.The summer before the story began, James had done the Darcy family a great service, almost certainly keeping Georgiana from ruin. Between the debt owed to the Bennets and the younger girls being away at school, Darcy's objections to the Bennets are greatly lessened. Despite the divide in their social standing, the Darcys and the Bennets find themselves drawn to each other. Yet, given their differing situations, can their connection ever become deeper than just friendship?Some portions of the story are copied directly from Pride and Prejudice. The story contains some mature scenes, although nothing is explicitly described.  Read more","Growing up, Clarissa was such a bookworm that her mother had to ground her from her books to make her do her household chores. At nine years old, she read Pride and Prejudice for the first time. The book had a luxurious red velvet cover, with golden trimmed pages and delightful illustrations. This version is still the one she uses when she wants to look back at the text.Clarissa Joy Thomas and her family, including two pet bunnies, live in Wisconsin, USA. Writing is an escape for Clarissa, as she can control what happens (at least to some extent). She encourages anyone who wants to write a book to do so. There are never enough books in the world. "," The premise assumes that instead of Jane Bennett, a son is born. The girls have an older brother who acts as protector and runs the estate. The entail will be broken with his first child and he has managed to make Longbourn fairly profitable, enough for the girls to have modest dowries. With the arrival of the Netherfield party, events are altered with his actions. Mary is a more interesting, outgoing character in this book. The younger girls go to school. Elizabeth us fairly true to canon except her brother helps curb her opinions and give her a male viewpoint several times, causing her to think over various events. Mr. Collins is worse than normal and I didn't particularly like how that story line played out for the victims but it was understandable. My only issue was it felt overly long and seemed to drag about around the 75% mark. "," This variation is very well written, although not perfect. The Bennet family has a firstborn named James, instead of Jane. He is an excellent son and elder brother to his four sisters, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia.He takes excellent care of the estate and when it seemed that his first love, since the age of twelve, is about to marry someone else, (Charles Bingley,) he proposes to and marries Charlotte Lucas.The heir presumptive, William Collins, visits, causing many problems and also much guilt. But things work out for most of the numerous couples that are documented herein. Worthy of a read! "," This is a saga. From the beginning there is no doubt this is not a retelling of Pride and Prejudice; although most of the characters are here, it is a completely new story. Sometimes it only plods along, but mostly it is an interesting, often riveting story. All characters are not properly fleshed out - the book would be twice as long if they were - but enough are to engage and make the reader long to know how they turn out. All in all a long, but very satisfying read. "," If you can imagine Jane Bennet’s character being male and the heir to longbourn then you will enjoy this story.  James Bennet becomes the caring brother and best master of the estate even with Mr and Mrs Bennet being the same characters.  James’ influence not helps his family estate prosper his sister’s benefit from his caring and concern.  There are villains a plenty and angst enough to fill all my boxes when I really enjoy a story.  This one is going in my favorites.  I would say don’t miss reading it.  The author was imaginative while keeping the storyline of the original. "," A nice long tale with interesting differences from canon.  Collins is a real sniveling monster but he gets his just deserts.  I liked the author's voice.  No typo or grammer errors.  I greatly enjoyed this and will look for more of her books. "," So. The premise was interesting and there were no problems grammatically that's the 3 stars.  Mr. Collins search. . .and subsequent trial got a bit vulgar. I understand that that's possible, but I don't really want to read about it, even in a mostly non-graphic way, in a Pride and Prejudice variation. There were a couple other sections that felt a bit vulgar as well. Again, not really graphic, but they could have been either cut out or some of them done in a more romantic way.  On that last note, the actual romance felt stilted and fairly unromantic.  The last of the major issues I had with it was the length. The main sequence of events and foreshadowing was good, but it felt like it took a long time to get anywhere. There were just too many words and  extraneous threads (the vicar and the wet-nurse, Darcy's many ball-room visits -including the inclusion of the lesbian girl he wishes wasn't, just why? - and almost compromise, the Tilneys, etc.) for good pacing. I think a full quarter of the story could have been cut out to the betterment of it.  To end on a good note, Lydia's character development was well-done. It was a nice to see someone who isn't afraid to write a villain that gets an appropriate-for-the-time punishment. The idea and also stupidity of the poisoning was well-done. I liked James, Elizabeth, and Mary's characters. "," Long book, works it’s way through an alternate plots of the Bennet heir. Pretty interesting but short on emotions that draw you into the story.  I had a good time but Darcy AND James chew the rug of who can have the most guilt for everybody in the world. "," An alternate universe where we have an elder brother Bennet instead of Jane, with many interesting plot twists resulting. Nice writing and intriguing possibilities. "

How refreshing to see not only a story from a Christian point of view, but to see such a large quote from the scriptures.Better still to read of an abused young woman to utilize that scripture to improve not only her own life, but also those around her as well.This ia a book I would recommend to anyone. Well done!! "," Congratulations are in order for this first effort from Ms Kendig.  She has managed to come up with an original idea, and to give it life through characters that you can care about.  Georgiana Darcy has an epiphany after reading a bible story about a strong and determined woman.  She is inspired by the story to a more active role in preventing George Wickham from preying upon vulnerable young women, the way that he preyed upon her.  Georgiana travels to Hertfordshire, where Wickham is stationed, and where her brother is visiting Bingley, and makes it her mission to warn everyone about Wickham's deceitful ways.This is a low angst tale, one in which the villains get what's coming to them, and in which Darcy and Elizabeth reach their resolution without most of the obstacles from the original P&P.  It's fun when characters like Georgiana, who is usually extremely timid and silent, are given a backbone and a personality, and have an important impact on the outcome.I'm not one for overly religious stories, and I was truly just confused by how anyone could receive inspiration from that particular bible story, but I felt the premise was good.  Jane Austen is a big proponent of girl power and strong female characters, and this author carries on that theme.  The book is well written and well edited.  I recommend it highly. "," I read this book before, it is a very different take. Georgiana is the heroine and later, Anne who follow the example of Jael from the Bible. Elizabeth and Darcy’s romance is not really the focus, more how the ladies change their own lives and impact others. I actually like the two characters and even Mr Collins was a surprise. I also appreciated that Elizabeth asked Darcy to wait, instead of just jumping into his arms. I just wanted more, more characters to engage into the story than be in the background. More romance, more story. There was so much potential for more "," Let me say I was turned off by the title. I kept overlooking this book since it first appeared in the kindle bookstore. I'm very glad I finally read it.  However the link to jael is weak and the references to jael don't add much to the storyline.  I very much enjoyed the Wickham storyline and how E and D reached their HEA. Hint no elopement and he gets what he deserves.  There were other parts that bothered me such as the ending.  The ending was weak and left me wanting more information.  How many children did E and D have?  Why didn't Anne marry Richard? What was Georgia's story after five years? The book synopsis says this about georgiana get there was little of her after the first half.  You can tell I am probably a 3.5 than a true 4.Give it a try for the unique variation. "," An excellent and entertaining story of how Georgiana Gets A Backbone (at last!) and the cousins FINALLY step in to save Anne from her overbearing mother. It doesn't ignore the all-important ODC romance, but it gives the Darcy/Fitzwilliam relatives some added depth that is very welcome.Religion was extremely important in Austen's society and the concept of two young women becoming inspired to stand up for themselves was deftly handled. It is neither ""preachy"" nor in any way zealous. Rather, it is the acceptance of the idea that even if fearful, standing up for what is right is liberating to the spirit.I'm impressed that this is a first novel. It's well-edited and the pacing is consistent. I don't follow many authors, but I'm going to be following Ms. Kendig. "," I love GD strength and determination. This story is quite unique and a fun read.I like how GW and LC are dealt with and GW is only really part of the first half of the story not dragged out.I'm a huge ODC  fan so loved this story that has them together earlier then the original and happy. Of course E didn't commit right away but there was also no insults on either end I think the author did an excellent job here and overall sweet romantic well done tale.I should state I had my kindle read the book to me so I am unaware of any grammar or spelling errors. "," I really enjoyed this story!  From the description I was not sure I would like this book.  But I really loved this author's books, The Banished Uncle & The Fortuitous Fall.  I am not attracted to her other book descriptions, but I will now be impatient to read them anyway! "," As the second of 5 daughters myself, it's not surprising my oldest sister and I share such an affinity for Pride and Prejudice. However, having never read a fan fiction before I was truly surprised at HOW MUCH I enjoyed ""I Am Jael"". Ms. Kendig did such an excellent job of capturing the characters voices it felt I was getting to hear additional conversations. Her descriptions were spot on making it very easy to visualize the alternate events. I don't want to give away any spoilers but suffice it to say the structure was ingenious! Many questions that are raised and situations that are left unresolved in the original that get satisfyingly addressed in this alternative version. I will happily recommend this to all of my P&P friends! "

If... if... if you will leave Miss Darcy alone and not try to interfere with her and not try to abduct her again, I will keep quiet, but if you try anything I will tell all.” Following on from Tact and Elizabeth Bennet’s marriage, the short stories in Turned Out Well cover the London debuts of the remaining Miss Bennets, the happenings at Rosings Park, and the marriage of the practical-minded Charlotte Lucas.

Jeannie is an easy sort of person to please and likes reading, writing and cooking-- particularly when the cooking involves cake. A good evening involves chocolate cake and a thick book."," Jeannie Peneaux has written some of the very best P&P variations on the market, so when I say that this book isn't my favorite of hers, it's not because the book isn't good (it is) or because I didn't enjoy it (I did). It's simply that she has set a very high bar.This book tells a series of shortish stories about characters who were secondary in canon: Kitty, Lydia, and Charlotte. The stories are well-told, are interesting, and build believably off the canon base while letting the characters grow, become better people, and fall in love in unusual and sweet ways.That said, the reality is that most of us who read P&P books do so in order to read about Elizabeth and Darcy. Those two were in this book, but as background characters. They were married throughout it, and they had some cute moments, but I personally wanted to see more of them. Still, this is a good book and is worth reading. It's just not a Lizzy and Darcy book. "," This is a charming collection of five short stories and two multi-chapter novellas that serve as sequels to Tact, this author's previous full-length Pride and Prejudice variation. It explores the subsequent lives of Elizabeth Darcy, Kitty and Lydia Bennet, and Georgiana as well as Lady Catherine and Charlotte Lucas.All these works are extremely well-written with nicely constructed plots. Characters are consistent with those established by Ms. Peneaux in the preceding novel. In some cases, that means there have been tweaks to Jane Austen's creations, so be prepared for some OOC behavior if you haven't read the previous book. That's especially true of Lady Catherine. Although romance features strongly in most stories, there's also pathos, adventure, and (in Charlotte's case) a more dispassionate approach to marriage.In fact, Charlotte's the heroine in one of the two novella-length stories. Since she remains unattached at the end of Tact, it's nice to see her land in a situation perfectly suited to her temperament and talents.However, it's Lydia who really shines throughout the pages of this book. In a short story describing Elizabeth's experience entering London society as Mrs. Darcy, Lydia's impeccable fashion sense comes to the attention of Beau Brummell. Lydia continues to be irrepressible, fearless, and unflinchingly honest in her own multi-chapter story fittingly titled Tactless. This is followed by yet another short story where her behavior is unconventional - to put it mildly.I thoroughly enjoyed reading about these ladies' lives and loves. Their personalities - as well as those in supporting roles (like Mr. Darcy) - fairly leap off the pages.Highly recommend! "," Sweet little novellas and vignettes, tying up loose ends for several characters from P&P.  This is several stories in one book, and follows the.marriage of Elizabeth and Darcy, and Jane and Bingley.  The stories cover what happens to Kitty, Lydia, Charlotte, Lady Catherine and Anne DeBourgh, and Mr.and Mrs. Bennett.  The author has managed to retain the exact tone of the original, and to preserve the personalities of those characters involved.  The book follows the variation written by the author, called ""Tact,"" so the scenario is different.  It would be helpful to read that book first so that you can follow where everyone is at the start of this variation.If you've read the first book, you know that in this version Lady Catherine is a sympathetic character, and not the ogre of the original.  Her vignette is particularly moving, as she is enduring tragedy and is reduced to a very human emotional state.  Lydia, being the most flamboyant character, is given perhaps the most dramatic story, and it's wonderful.  She undergoes by far the most radical evolution in circumstances, and very surprising ones at that.  Charlotte 's story, plain and practical Charlotte, is another quite wonderful creation.  Her outcome is cleverly tied into Lydia's story, and the result is most satisfying.All of these stories are well written and well edited.  I recommend it highly. "," My first Jeannie Peneaux book was 'Tact' and I read it for free on Fan Fiction. But the story was so well done, that I bought a copy for my Kindle and had just re-read Tact again before reading her new entry, 'Turned Out Well.'I rarely read any books that don't focus solely on my favorite couple, 'Elizabeth and Darcy.' However, my love of her witty dialogue, her characters that seem to live and breathe and the lack of too much angst had me buying her new book. I adored the book and the continuation of witty dialogue and 'all-to-real' characters. I am also marveling that Ms. Peneaux  managed to get me to like both Lydia and Catherine de Bourgh! It takes an exceptional author to turn your head around from hating to loving a character. The last time that happened to me it was G.R.R. Martin and the character of Jamie Lannister. Without spoiling anything, I encourage everyone to read Lydia's tale. It keeps Lydia firmly in character, but due to Elizabeth's 'tact' and wonderful influence, Lydia becomes someone you admire. It was Lydia's story that was my favorite.Now if Ms. Peneaux could please write another Pride and Prejudice variation that focuses solely on our darling couple, I will be very happy indeed. "

Although she discovered Jane Austen’s novels as a college sophomore, she didn’t begin writing Austenesque until several years later. ""The Muse: A Pride and Prejudice Variation"" is her debut novel. Jessica teaches English in a New York City public school. In her spare time, she reads a lot of Young Adult literature, enjoys walks in Prospect Park, and cooks and eats as healthily as possible. She lives in Brooklyn, NY."," Ballet is not my thing. In fact, my sweetie once asked if he could get me tickets to the ballet for my birthday, and I told him that ballet tickets would be a gift to himself; if he wanted to give <i>me</i> a present, he should buy me tickets to a Lakers game! That’s my notion of ballet.So it’s not surprising that some aspects of <i>The Muse</i> went right over my head. I can’t picture the different moves, or even really understand the emotions they are supposed to evoke. What I was able to understand was the electric reaction our hero and heroine (Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, for anyone not yet clued in) felt the first time they touched, when Darcy used Elizabeth to help him choreograph a <i>pas de deux.</i> The vivid yet tasteful description of that scene certainly twisted my knickers!Back up. In this variation on <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> set in the present day, Jane and Elizabeth Bennet are dancers in the Ballet Theater of New York, and William Darcy is a former dancer turned freelance choreographer who is invited in to create a new dance for the current season. Many of the familiar character names from <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> turn up, some names more or less modified, though their characters don’t always match the original (Georgiana in particular is completely different) and the plot is not closely followed. The emphasis here is on the romance, which to my mind is a different genre from what Jane Austen wrote, so the focus and the arc of the story diverge considerably. In fact, I’m not sure using the character names from <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> was even necessary; a story about, say, Ashley Smith and Shane Matthews would still have had echoes of P&P without raising expectations that certain situations and conversations would be found. Though such a novel would have been harder to sell to Meryton Press, no doubt.So why five stars? Because this novel works perfectly well on its own terms, leaving aside the <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> parallels. I enjoyed the setting in the professional dance world, and that world was described in ways that allowed an uninitiated person like myself to understand enough to become emotionally involved in the dramas and conflicts that arose. I’m not personally a fan of sex scenes, but the few that appeared were handled very well (not so explicit that I was squirming), and the many more scenes involving frustrated attraction were handled even better. Considering that this is modern romance and not a period piece, it seemed entirely appropriate that the details of how William and Elizabeth worked out their relationship should have been elaborated in more detail at the end. It made them more credible and well rounded. Other changes served to make the story work well on its own terms.Because this is a modern novel and not a pale imitation of Jane Austen, Jessica Evans felt free to use techniques not found in Georgian fiction. I particularly liked one scene, which took place before William and Elizabeth came to see eye to eye, in which the point of view switched back and forth between the two characters during an uncomfortable dinner date. Seeing their thoughts allowed us to grasp vividly just how wide was the gulf between them. Also perhaps because this is a modern novel, the characters in general expressed themselves more freely, were ruder to one another, and behaved in more extreme ways (e.g., in the original, Caroline Bingley might contemplate sabotage of Elizabeth, but here she gets to act it out, in a scene that allows echoes of <i>Cinderella</i> to creep in). There is a tendency among modern adaptors to make Jane Austen’s comedy broader; this sometimes bothers me, but didn’t in the case of <i>The Muse</i> because the story wasn’t slavishly following the original.There were moments, especially early in the book before the story took on its own momentum, when I felt the presence of a writer who was a little constrained by the “Austen variation” genre. I hope that writer comes to the fore in future books. One such moment came when Elizabeth has changed into street clothes and gone back to the rehearsal room, where she hears some criticism that she shouldn’t have heard: “As she spun around, her sneakers shrieked against the floor.” The shrieking of the rubber soles on a wood floor is a sharply observed detail that also works to express Elizabeth’s inwardly screaming thoughts, thoughts she is not in a position to express. I also recall a wonderful reference to “the noisy privacy of Columbus Avenue.”When I wrote my first novel, I used <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> as a crutch; diving deep into that novel and adapting it allowed me to learn a great deal about writing fiction. Perhaps it served the same purpose for Jessica Evans, and I hope that, going forward, she’ll let go of the crutch and give free rein to that original, perceptive writer inside. "," 3.5 rounded up. I liked this a lot, but I think I would have appreciated it more if it hadn't been P&P themed. I've read hundreds of JAFF and, therefore, have a certain expectation for it. I think, ultimately, it was Elizabeth that brought this down for me. Elizabeth is meant to be this charismatic, witty, lively young woman who makes light of Darcy's arrogance and manners. But she takes them very much to heart in this book and it makes her character very heavy, not in a good way. She is paranoid and tense and jealous of Jane. She never really displays any of the wit that is so central to Jane Austen's character.For being P&P themed, a lot of the main P&P plots were glossed over or omitted altogether. Jane never gets sick, she hurts her ankle but the next time we see her, she's fine, hiking even! Therefore, there's no prolonged stay at Netherfield. D, E, J, Bingley, and Caroline spend a day an a half at a cabin together, but E spends most of it hiding in her room so very little nasty Caroline and very little debating with D. The Charlotte/Collins fiasco is condensed to one single scene where she attends a function with him (and then we only see the riding to the function in a limo together) then we never see Collins (Colin Williams) again. Lydia is named, but she plays almost no role in the story at all. She's just a background friend of E's. Wickham never does anything after D reveals his true character. No ""eloping with Lydia"" plot at all. He, also, just disappears after E makes it known that she is aware of his past. B never leaves J so there's no J pining for him. He doesn't promote her, but they keep dating and are perfectly happy. We never meet E&J's parents at all, so no eccentric Mr. Bennet or flighty, nervous Mrs. Bennet.Georgiana's character was...different. She was not this shy, demure young lady. In fact, she came across as an overexcited ADHD valley girl! Everything she said was followed with !'s which made her seem super excited about everything all the time!I'm not sure how I felt about D&E's one night stand...if this hadn't been P&P themed, I wouldn't bat an eye at it. But for there to be so much intimacy between ODC at such an early juncture (essentially, right after the Netherfield Ball) was strange. They're meant to argue and then walk away from one another at this point, not fall into bed together.Putting aside my expectations, this was a very good book. I didn't put it down until 2:30am then picked it right back up when I woke up and didn't get out of bed until I was done. I don't know anything about ballet, but never felt particularly lost. I didn't know all the terms, but was still able to follow the story perfectly fine. I felt E&D's emotions, I hurt with them, I was angry with them. This was very well written and edited. I think that if the characters had different names and this had been just a stand alone romance novel, I would have absolutely loved it. I think if you can forget about this being a modern P&P variation, it's a great book. I hope this author will venture to write something original becuz she's talented and intriguing. "

They find him too tall; his hair is too short; his hair is too floppy; why is his nose so very large? How can they cajole him into investing in their projects or marrying their daughters?On and on it goes. An endless parade of banality and avarice. Until he accompanies his friend to Hertfordshire...*Think of Me is a slightly paranormal story that features the inner workings of an adult man's mind. It might not be suitable for young readers. Mature readers, enjoy!**Elizabeth Adams has never used, and has no plans to use, AI in her writing. She wouldn't even know where to begin.  Read more","Elizabeth Adams is a book-loving, tango-dancing, Austen enthusiast. She loves old houses and thinks birthdays should be celebrated with trips - as should most occasions. She can often be found by a sunny window with a cup of hot tea and a book in her hand. She writes romantic comedy and comedic drama. You can find more information, short stories, and outtakes at www.EAdamsWrites.com"," Not completely sure how I feel about this one. There were elements I liked, but quite a few things I disliked. I was very turned off to read about how Darcy had previous relations with a widow. Almost wanted to stop reading then because I absolutely hate that in a story, but I powered through because I was so interested in the premise. It seemed a superfluous detail though really. It was only mentioned a couple of times and had no real effect on the story. I really don’t see why it was included at all.Lady Cassandra’s experience was unexpected. Felt bad for the effect it had on her, but was pleasantly surprised by the trickle down effect it had on the Bennets and Elizabeth’s cunning way of dealing with Lydia.It was also interesting to read how Darcy’s curiosity of Elizabeth builds. How as his interest is sewn, their connection is formed. He knows she doesn’t like him, but how can he fix it when she’s never expressed her feelings? That was dealt with surprisingly quickly actually. I’m not sure how I feel about him suddenly not being able to hear her thoughts as much after feelings were formed though. It seemed inconsistent like he could hear them sometimes yet not others. Also he seemed adamant to her that he could only hear thoughts about himself, but then a page later he talks about hearing his cousins thoughts about his paramour, so that obviously doesn’t stand for people other than her. That piece really was confusing and made little sense. I will say I was worried going in that it’d be Twilight-esq in that he felt relief around her because he couldn’t hear her mind, but was relieved to see that the authoress went a different, much more enjoyable direction with the story.I also enjoyed that other characters’ inner workings are described like Mrs. Bennet’s erratic emotions. I really felt like Mary’s storyline was left hanging though. She is unduly prideful and we’re just supposed to forget about her? Hate that because I’ve always felt so much compassion for Mary essentially being the forgotten sister, so was sad that she was mentioned some in the beginning then seemed to disappear. Lydia has a quick moment, then is quickly forgotten. Jane has a beau, who we never meet and who is rarely mentioned? So many storylines that didn’t make sense or were just left hanging.I usually absolutely love Elizabeth Adams’s works and while this had an interesting storyline, it just lacked feeling, which is sad because I love stories from Darcy’s perspective especially ones with a paranormal element to it. The last 25 or so pages made it worth the read though. Some sweet D&E interactions, especially loved the proposal and thoughts of their lives together. However, overall the writing felt kind of soulless for most of the story. It’s hard to explain, but most of the story lacked emotion in the writing, so it was hard to feel connected to it until like 3/4th of the way through and even then very rarely were emotions described. It was more telling the story through actions. Example from this story, “he leaned forward, slowly, and pressed his lips to mine. It was only for a moment, but his lips were warm and soft, and I enjoyed the tingle they left behind. ‘I should like to do that again,’ I said without thinking. ‘You are one of the few people who can surprise me,’ he said, a smile in his voice. Then he kissed me again, this time bringing his hands to my face and holding me as if I was precious to him.”Yet in The Peculiar Talent of Miss Elizabeth Bennet (pg. 56 on kindle), “Elizabeth awoke with a start. Her heart was pounding. She placed her hand on her chest and forced herself to take deep breaths. It was still dark in her room and the fire had gone down. Throwing back the counterpane and letting in the cool air helped to calm her. She had never had a dream like that! It had been so real. So very detailed. She had felt his hands on her skin. She had felt the hair on his chest beneath her fingertips. Her entire body felt flushed and alive, every nerve at attention. Her heart still beat too quickly, and her breath came too short. Hesitantly, she raised a hand to her lips. They still tingled from his kisses.”The writing is so very different between the two stories yet they were only published less than a year apart. I had heard the authoress had started using AI for her books, but I didn’t think it’d change her writing so much. Sadly it’s quite noticeable in the deterioration of her writing in such a short time period. I hope this isn’t the future of JAFF. It’d be a shame for such talented writers to waste their immense talent by using software to do the work for them especially when they are so much better at expressing emotion between characters without it.ETA: I apologize for saying Ms. Adams used AI. She changed the description to say she does not use AI. I stand by my rating based on the first 6 paragraphs, but retract the last stating that she uses AI. I’m not sure why this story was so different than her previous writings. It is still an interesting premise and I plan to read her future works. Maybe she’ll come up with a sequel to tie up all these loose ends. "," Before I bought my copy, I read the first review and thought, ""Are you kidding me? I don't think Elizabeth Adams would even know how to begin using AI to write her books."" And then I looked at the description and I see that she basically said the same thing (I'm sure in response to that review).There's a lot of controversy around authors using AI to help them crank out both fiction and nonfiction books, but I've been following this author pretty much for her entire writing career, and I happen to know that the idea for this book came to her a few years ago. Another idea recently sparked the writing of the story. She built in accountability to get sections completed within certain timeframes, and I had the honor of reading an ARC, so I can say with full confidence that this is an entirely original work, and the only AI involved was ""Adams Intelligence.""By the way, there's another author by the name of Elizabeth Ann West who claims to use AI to quickly write and publish books. But that's another story entirely.THIS story--Think of Me--is juicy and delicious and worth getting your hands on. Elizabeth Adams is a master at metaphorical language, her pacing is perfect, and her witty banter makes me want to be friends with her version of Elizabeth Bennet.This one is steamier than some of her earlier works, which I secretly hope is foreshadowing her subsequent works because she does it well. It's also a treck off the beaten path, weaving a paranormal twist into an age-old tale.Bravo, Ms. Adams. Let those creative juices continue to flow organically. Your true fans know your voice and can't get enough.Oh, and did I mention this book is delicious? DELICIOUS. "," 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 stars.This story gives us alternating viewpoints from Darcy and then Elizabeth. It has a sci-fi twist in that Darcy can both hear all the thoughts of others as they pertain to him and then can also sense their feelings or moods.Ironically, Elizabeth suddenly has the same ability...after she ""hears"" an insult at the Assembly which she thinks is about her. However, she has the ability to ""shut the door"" on that talent, closing off any incoming thoughts.I enjoyed reading how quickly Darcy felt comfort and ease in exchanging thoughts with Elizabeth. Soon he found himself flirting and teasing, which he had never done.There are several other characters who also find love in this story. However, one pairing is different from canon. Mr. Bennet makes a remark that leaves both ODC and the reader wondering towards the end of the story. There is no epilogue, which was appropriate for this story.Although there was no angst there are several events which are mentioned which are only appropriate for adult readers. I enjoyed this shorter story. "," This author is an automatic purchase for me. Wonderful and humorous writing, and clever, imaginative stories. From birth, Darcy has been able to hear other's thoughts, as long as the thoughts are about him. When he comes to Netherfield with Bingley, he's almost immediately drawn to Elizabeth because of the soothing and playful nature of her thoughts. His particular ""gift"" has ensured that he no longer considers status and fortune as the most important considerations when making friends. He now knows that a person's character is the most important factor. He seems almost powerless against the strength of his attraction to Elizabeth. Then all hell breaks loose when he discovers that Elizabeth has begun to sense his thoughts as well.This is a really fun story, and the romance is lovely. There are some new characters introduced, and they greatly enrich the experience. I only wished that the book was longer. It's well written and well edited. I recommend it highly for a wonderfully entertaining tale with a dash of fantasy thrown in. "

After Mr. B’s death and Lydia’s marriage to Wickham, the remaining Bennets are crammed into the Gardiners’ home in London. All three elder sisters try to find work to save up enough for the family to move into other housing, but unskilled and without references, they are forced to take menial employment whenever they can find an occasional job.NOTE: **SPOILERS FOLLOW**When Darcy discovers that Mr. B has died, he visits the Gardiners and finds Lizzy close to tears, knowing her uncle is furious at Lydia. Feeling responsible (again!) he proposes a second time, promising to take care of her sisters and mother. Lydia has abandoned her baby son to her sisters.Lizzy reluctantly lies to him about the baby, as the Bennets are sure that Darcy will detest even the presence of Wickham’s son. At Pemberley, Darcy and Lizzy eventually admit their love and lust for one another, and there are a number of lovemaking scenes.Although sensitively handled, they’re very repetitive and I honestly felt they were simply filler. It’s great that Darcy had a thing for “...Lizzy’s legs wrapped around his waist”, but that line gets repeated in three or four different lovemaking scenes. However, it was a nice humorous touch when Mary breaks into tears after her first kiss!The story’s angst comes not only from Lizzy’s lie about Edward, but also a touch of mystery when someone breaks into Pemberley to try to steal Edward. I already had a bit of trouble accepting Lizzy as a passive heroine, but the abortive kidnapping made her seem dim-witted.Passing Edward off as a servant’s son meant there was no reason anyone would come all the way to Derbyshire, to break into a mansion and attempt to steal a baby. How would they even know which room the babe was in? Even if everyone thought Wickham wouldn’t be interested in his son, he is the only logical suspect. That this didn’t occur to Lizzy was dumbfounding. One would think it screams ‘Wickham Wants Money!’ in large letters.When Darcy learns the truth, it is Bingley who helps him accept it. This scene felt rushed, perhaps because the story builds up Darcy’s explosive temper whenever Wickham is even mentioned, but a few words from Bingley and he drops all resentment against the Bennets and talks about groveling to Lizzy for forgiveness.Lydia finally learns some lessons in life, and the other sisters end up more happily married. An epilogue wraps up the Darcys’ idyllic life and introduces the next generation.There are a number of errata that even cursory editing would have corrected. In one instance Darcy is leaving Rosings in a stagecoach – it’s hard to believe he wouldn’t have ridden or taken one of his coaches. Stagecoaches were slow and public; it makes no sense he wouldn’t have at least hired a private coach.Several homonyms show up, “site” instead of ‘sight’, “ring” instead of ‘wring’, “waving” instead of ‘waiving’. The story even has a misspelling of the Gardiners’ name, although it’s correct spelled in all other instances.Summarizing this JAFF: It has some good writing in it, and the dialogue mostly works except when the author seems to rush the pace too much. But Lizzy was insecure and passive, quite different from canon, and I missed having the ODC relationship grow and mature. Here we get the results of their loving relationship, but the journey is all action without an equal amount of emotional interaction between Lizzy and Darcy. There is much lovemaking, but no depth displayed. "," I enjoyed reading this story and found nothing wrong with it besides it being too short. Elizabeth and Darcy of course get together but not until after Mr Bennet dies and the girls are left fairly destitute. Mrs Bennet is essentially bedridden in her grief, Lydia has married Wickham and has a child.  Fortunately she realizes that she's incapable of taking care of another human being and leaves her child with Elizabeth. Wickham.has already decamped for other women with more money than his wife.  Darcy comes to the rescue and although Elizabeth is in love with him -- she doesn't tell him bc she's under the impression that he married her bc of her situation not that he's in love with her still.  The family decided to not tell him who the father is of this baby bc of his hatred of Wickham. And THAT causes all the problems...The characters are the same except for being muted a bit. Lady Catherine isn't as loud and obnoxious, Mrs Bennet isn't as flighty, Elizabeth isn't as quick to make judgements, and Darcy is more understanding than typical and is very kind to the young Bennet girls.In short, I enjoyed reading it, and I recommend it to others. "," This is a lovely story, with a little angst, a lot of lovely family time, and a heartwarming ending. It’s well written with multiple scenes that bring tears to the eyes, either for their rawness or their joy.However it loses a star or two for editing. It feels a little as though there was a word limit applied and too much was cut, or skipped over, to make it fit.It’s unclear whether Elizabeth rejected two proposals from Darcy or only one; the timing doesn’t properly fit for the first one to be the only one, but no explanation is given for why she would have rejected another. I spent the first third or more thinking there must have been two but ended up deciding probably not. In fact, I’m not sure if the author might not have been u decided also.The same applies to Bingley’s desertion. Initially it seemed to read as though there’d be a second desertion, but later it seemed not.Later there are other times when detail seems to be skipped over, or time jumps, that should be clearer.Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable read, and when the writing wasn’t rushing it was well done. "," This was a very enjoyable read containing mature scenes between a happily married couple.  It was a great adventure into the ‘what ifs’ that are so fun to explore in JAFF.  WHAT IF Mr. Bennet died? Lydia and her child were abandoned by the horrible Wickham? What if the remaining Bennets were forced to seek work in London to support their family? Most of all, what if our dear Darcy still pines for Elizabeth after so many months trying to forget her? Many swoon worthy moments, both steamy and sweet as ODC find their way to each other. "," Enjoyed reading this variation. I was a bit taken back when the Gardiner children were basically non-existent and the Gardiner's weren't the loving, giving characters I normally expect them to be.  All Elizabeth's guilt over keeping the truth from Darcy regarding Edward could have been written a bit better. All and all enjoyable read. "," Great story but much too much Lydia for my taste. Also, sometimes Elizabeth’s stubbornness is more stupidity. Impoverished and destitute and she still was unsure about accepting Darcy’s proposal. That was certainly the case in this variation. "," I loved the strength of character of Lizzie and Darcy.  I especially liked that Mrs. Bennett grew in character.  As always, Lydia and Wickham were selfish and self centered. "

It begins after Jane and Elizabeth's stay at Netherfield Park during Jane's illness.  Jane has a relapse after their return to Longbourn, which brings Bingley and Darcy there daily to visit, resulting in a lot more time for Elizabeth and Darcy to get to know each other better.  Wickham's negative influence is removed because Darcy confides in Elizabeth much earlier and decides to warn the neighborhood against him.  These changes in the storyline have an impact on many of the characters.This isn't great literature, but sometimes we just need a nice easy story with some easy romance, and this is one.  It's tremendously satisfying when Elizabeth and Darcy don't have to go through all of the misunderstandings and acrimony, and instead learn each other's good qualities without so much struggle.  The heartaches that they do have are very minor.This author is a talented writer and storyteller.  Although there are many scenes where events happen a little too conveniently, it's still a pleasant way to pass a few hours.  It's well written and well edited.  I recommend it. "," Modern phrases and attitudes abound, as do the errata. Darcy is melancholic after his disastrous Hunsford proposal. His Fitzwilliam relatives are worried, and decide he needs a wife. They inveigle him to attend social events, and even get him to promise to dance!Elizabeth has read Darcy's letter and is full of regrets. She receives a distraction when her father informs her that he is finally taking charge of his family. Lydia has acted disgracefully, and will be disciplined. Mr. B proposes to send Jane and Elizabeth for a London season.It's inevitable that ODC will meet. They stumble around one another, but there is no real angst here. Unfortunately, the author has Darcy expressing attitudes that are preposterous for a traditional upper-class male in 1812 England. It is unrealistic that both Elizabeth and Darcy would insist upon being ""just good friends"", let alone that Darcy would think friendship with a woman is an essential part of a sound marriage.JAFFs are aimed at being entertaining romantic fiction. But if you want a modern day marriage of equals, 1812 England is the wrong time and place. Women were not even a person, in the eyes of the law at that time – they were property, in the same way as a carriage or a mirror.I could not figure out the bet beween the Bennet family members and Darcy. Quite apart from the fact that historically, no non-relative would ever consider proposing such a thing, let alone doing it, what was the point? He couldn't ask for help and simply receive advice without having to bribe them for it?Elizabeth waffled a lot about her unsuitability, which became tiresome after a while. Darcy reassured her with speeches that were straight out of 21st century PC (politically correct). Jane Austen must be rolling in her grave. "," It's a little different from the classic but the essentials are in place.  There's minimum of great angst and Darcy isn't as foreboding as his usual.  He and Elizabeth actually become friends and spend a good amount of time together just talking.I like this Mrs Bennet because she's not as mean to Elizabeth and is nicer to Darcy rather than the usual severe dislike and her verbally expressed dislike of him. N "," This is the second book of this ""What if"" series.  I thought thayt the first story was better.  It had sufficient content to keep the story engaging and moving ahead.  This story has some novel ideas and good dialog, but degenerates into a series of misunderstandings and untimely interruptions that stagnate the action.  When all of the parties end up at Longbourn to tie up loose ends, Kitty asks Darcy ""Who won the bet?"" ( we aren't told previously in the story about the bet).  Ellizabeth wonders why she languished over the relationship with Darcy instesd of just outright asking.  I wondered, too. "," This author is very good at getting her characters to speak their minds to each other.  This cuts down on angst. Therefore, Elizabeth should be on firm ground yet she still, even after they are married, makes Darcy think she doubts him when really she does not admit to thinking herself unworthy. Which is rather sad.  I like that Darcy ingratiated himself into the Bennet family while Elizabeth is away but it is never really explained how that calms their most excitable members. "," This is now one of my absolute favorites. The amount of detail covered in these pages was astounding. It felt neither rushed nor lacking.The interactions were meaningful and beautifully done. The dialogue between E&D was poignant and so heartfelt. I enjoyed that the conflict came from the couple and not outside forces.I kept waiting for there to be a let down in the story in order to spare myself disappointment, but happily there was no need for my concern; there was no let down. This was beautifully paced, beautifully written, and beautifully executed. "," Though this installment of Squire's ""What if?"" series has more misunderstandings and angst than the other two books, it is no less enjoyable. In fact, it has my favorite line from Jane in the whole series and one of the most adorable plots I've ever read. Highly recommend this one as well! "," This variation is not bad but I kept waiting for some interesting storyline to distinguish and since it never happened, I found the story lacking. "

Recommend this variation. "," The most important part, perhaps, is this:  what is Miss Bingley doing in this novel?  Seriously. Why was she invited?  Darcy’s clearly estranged from Mr Bingley and, as in canon, is not personal friends with Miss Bingley, so what is she doing here? It’s a sloppy plot device. The Matlocks are also throwaway parts, but Miss Bingley’s shoehorned presence is more egregious.So much is off in this story. I’m sorry Lizzy’s first husband died, because it sounds like she loved him and was happy with him. She certainly didn’t pine away for Darcy, any more than Darcy did for her in their seven years apart. I found myself hoping against hope that her husband would be found at sea so he could take her out of this book. Once they’ve reconnected, there’s no chemistry between them, and no character growth. For example this Darcy feels but a momentary guilt for not telling Elizabeth about Wickham, a guilt he doesn’t reveal to Elizabeth. It’s a shame, because that guilt is an essential part of Austen’s Darcy and drives him to become someone worthy of Lizzy’s love.In the end, I’m not even entirely sure he gets over his pride. Does he want to marry her?  Yes, finally, I guess. Will he regret it in the back of his mind?  All indications are yes. Elizabeth also lacks development. She certainly faces nothing that forces her to reconsider her first impressions or otherwise see life through a different lens. The characters are the same people from first page to last, which is unfair to both characters and reader.Darcy’s cold parenting skills, while probably in line with Regency mores, do not make him appealing or noble to the modern reader. He already has enough strikes against him; seeing his relationship with Kathy did him no favors with the reader.Finally, Austen places Pemberley is in Derbyshire; there’s no reason to locate it in Yorkshire. "," I’m not a fan of the Lizzy is the governess hired by Darcy trope. Going from governess to Mrs. Darcy always feels patched together. It’s still true in the story here.An ok story with tons of possibilities but imho it could have been so much better. We all know there is going to be an HEA so to make a fun story it would have been nice if the plot time was increased with more about Darcy, Lizzy and Kathy, his child. We get some moment between the 3 but it all feels secondary to the main plot which is the angst of misunderstandings and how can a governess slide into the position of wife without ruining the Darcy name.3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars because it is a Kindle Unlimited book publish during the Coronavirus pandemic and an ok book now is as good as good book any other time. "," The premise is that Darcy never did give his letter of explanation to Elizabeth after the World's Worst Proposal. As a result they parted and married others. Conveniently both other spouses die and so seven years later, ODC meet again.But this time the Bennets are impoverished. Bingley never returned to marry Jane. Mr. Bennet spent a huge sum buying Lydia a respectable husband after the Wickham elopement. Charlotte and Mr. Collins now live at Longbourn. Jane married a tradesman, and although happily married there are still financial troubles. Elizabeth feels she must find a job rather than sponge off Jane and her family.Darcy hires Elizabeth to help his daughter Kathy, who is becoming a spoilt miniature Lady C. Of course Elizabeth Hertier nee Bennet has the magic touch to win over his bratty little offspring. And Darcy was quite wrong to think he could be anywhere near Elizabeth without falling in love all over again.It all follows an obvious storyline, and cliches abound. ODC get their HEA. This wasn't the worst JAFF I've ever read, but I don't think I'm going to keep this one permanently. YMMV. "," I didn’t think I would like his one very much but I do.  Characters are well developed and true to Austen, plot is strong, and story is well written.  Downside:  Too short!  Also, the absence of the Colonel is never explained....did he die?  Lady Catherine also seems vacant from story as surely her character would be forever meddling in her granddaughter’s life.  What about Wickham?  He abandoned Lydia, but would his character have simply disappeared from tormenting Darcy over he last 7 years?  As I said, story was too short — one star off, but kudos to the author for a Variation well worth the read. "," After seven years of separation Darcy and Elizabeth are reunited as employer and employee. Elizabeth was hired as a governess for windrower Darcy's daughter.  The variation is well written it's held my interest. However I felt some of the characters were not needed, like Miss Bingley and the Matlocks.  Darcy's character was like a rollercoaster, he want to love, protect and defend her but can not declared his feelings for fear of rejection.  Elizabeth was more concern with her status within the household. The characters of Georgianna and her husband, Barry were well written and offer comic relief.  Overall I liked this variation "," As much as I detest the thought of Darcy and Elizabeth marrying before discovering a happy marriage together, I gave this book a chance.  I didn't enjoy every aspect of it especially when Darcy does all the wrong things, I did enjoy the story.  So I determined that love is better late than never, especially when narrated in such a delightful way.  Unlike many wanna be authors of fan fiction, Monica knows Elizabeth and Darcy and wrote them true to character.  Thanks for a good read. "

Collins and Anne are engaged, the Colonel accompanies her to Hertfordshire, Caroline worries about things, and Darcy and Elizabeth argue about Wickham.  It was pleasant enough but I am not a fan of the serial publishing, would prefer to read the entire story at once. "," 3.5 starsI'm rather conflicted about how to rate this installment of the A Long Road Home series. My dilemma comes because I really dislike cliffhangers. I want a good resolve of some kind by the end of a book even if the story continues in the next one. In the first book, Anne, the story ends in a bang with a shocking moment that made me feel motivated to find out what happens next. It is a cliffhanger and I expected it would resolve in the next book. It did not. Elizabeth's book was disappointing to me because not only did nothing get a final resolve, it didn't feel like it went anywhere. It ends with every relationship treading water. Anne is still hanging in the air, Elizabeth & Darcy are no where and Bingley just deserted Jane for London. If this series had been written as one longer book, I'd be loving it but broken up it feels frustrating to me.I suspect that by the end of the series, I will have loved the entirety of the story, including this installment. I just don't like waiting for the next one to be able to finish reading to get the resolve I seek. I'd likely give 5 stars for the full story but this installment was not my favorite.No sex, language or violence*I received a complimentary ARC and voluntarily chose to review it. "

"," This was my first sensual Pride and Prejudice variation, so my expectations were both of excitement and trepidation. Elizabeth and Darcy were the loving couple as in a typical variation, when in the beginning their journey to Longbourn is interrupted by a kidnapping. Thankfully, the angst and trauma levels are reduced by not-too-graphic language as well as quick thinking and hands by Lizzy and Darcy; however, that episode still had its excitement. I also greatly enjoyed the sexual play between the couple, in which the author depicted them as equals and not the male dominating over the female. As for the ending, it has this ease and resolution that was a relief if a bit too easy. The relationships in this book besides those of Elizabeth and Darcy are lovingly demonstrated with a good balance of brevity and expounding, which is great for this type of piece. What bugged me are some misspellings (particularly fiancée) and to a lesser extent more word variation, although in this case it is not quite as bothersome as usual.

He thought her dull and illiterate. Then he realized his mistake. Oh the thoughts he would have on her from then on  was so sweet. Both too stubborn to take initiative in romance when they both desired it. I like the outcomes for all the girls in this one. So much better I would say than the original. Oops! "," I enjoyed this book and the way ODCs relationship blossomed. A bad George wickham was portrayed well. I recommend for those who can take angst "," A re-imagining, rather than a variation, I would say, as there is nothing similar to the original P&P in how Elizabeth and Darcy meet.  Elizabeth is on holiday with the Gardiners in Kent.  They are delayed at an inn because certain bridges have been damaged, and their carriage can't go forward.  Elizabeth takes a walk in the woods to pass time, and observes a man with a pistol who is about to shoot at an oncoming carriage.  She sneaks up on the gunman and prevents him from aiming at the vehicle, but then she's thrown into a gully by the gunman, and is severely injured.  When she regains consciousness, she's compromised, and forced to marry the man she saved, who is Mr Darcy.Because of dire circumstances, Darcy has to marry Elizabeth and then leave her in a rented house in Kent.  She doesn't see him again for a few months, during which time she's recovering from her severe injuries.  This is, of course, a less than ideal way to begin a marriage.  They don't know each other at all, they're both feeling trapped in a marriage neither one wanted, and their only means of communication is impersonal letters.  I like the authors' subtle humor surrounding their exchange of letters, when Darcy is reaching the conclusion that he's married to an illiterate simpleton because of Elizabeth's poor handwriting, and because of the content of her letters, both of which are directly influenced by her bad injuries.  Fortunately, this misjudgment doesn't go on too long, and all of the misconceptions get cleared up fairly quickly.  I'm glad that Darcy comes to his senses sooner rather than later, and he esteems Elizabeth before too long.Georgiana is a surprise in this book, and not a pleasant one.  She's another Lydia in words and actions, and one Lydia is way more than enough.  Lady Catherine and Anne DeBourgh are fairly evil and abusive, and I was hoping for a comeuppance that never happens.  Anne DeBourgh is actually rewarded for her evil, I felt, which didn't sit well with me.  I don't like to see such bad villains get anything good.The main villain is Wickham, and he's a real doozy.  I felt that the scene late in the book where Wickham gets what's coming to him was dragged out way too long, and gave Lydia way more screen time than she should have had.  However, the book is well written and well edited.  I recommend it as an interesting story. "," 5+ stars!This is a thrilling adventure that's quite different from the light novellas this duo usually writes. Though it's not devoid of humor, generally this has a more serious tone.We find Mr. Wickham at his absolute worst, obsessed with how Darcy has ruined his life and determined to get his revenge. He's wooing Georgiana Darcy at Ramsgate with with Mrs. Younge's assistance, but there are some new tweaks. He gets advanced warning that Darcy is on the way and comes up with a way to slow him down - or better still, to kill him. Wickham positions himself near a bridge he knows Darcy will cross, having sabotaged it, intending to shoot one of the horses pulling his enemy's carriage and cause it to fall down the side of the cliff.Elizabeth Bennet happens to be in the area exploring the sights with the Gardiners. She goes for a walk in the woods near the inn where they're staying and spots Wickham poised to shoot at a carriage about to cross an obviously vandalized bridge. Suffice to say, she saves Darcy and his servants, but Wickham pushes her down the cliffside, knocking her unconscious and severely injuring her.The villain gets away, and Darcy tends to the unknown lady who intervened. He gets her a room and the medical attention she requires, but his servants are unable to locate her family until the next day. Meanwhile, Darcy finds he has no option but to stay in her room to watch over her until she wakes up. The circumstances lead to a forced marriage scenario.Unfortunately, once the Gardiners arrive, Darcy has no time at all to spend with Elizabeth. First he has to rush off to Ramsgate - he deduces that Wickham must be targeting his sister - and then he has an emergency situation at his estate in Scotland that requires his presence for several months. He squeezes in a quick wedding ceremony between the two journeys, leaving the new Mrs. Darcy with Bennet family members who come to help her recover since she's not well enough to travel. Her injuries include a break in her left (writing) hand, so she pens her letters to him using the other hand, causing him to believe his wife must be illiterate and poorly educated....And that's only the beginning!The story continues to evolve, showing an unusual side to Mrs. Younge, Georgiana behaving like a typical rebellious adolescent (especially when paired with Lydia Bennet), Anne de Bourgh being particularly devious, Colonel Fitzwilliam taking on a challenging role, Mr. Wickham continuing to plot against Darcy, and much, much more. Oh, and Darcy and Elizabeth gradually getting to know each other with lots of tantalizing touches and stares long before they finally consummate their marriage (which occurs off-page - content is clean). Everything weaves together nicely with no distracting tangents. Wonderful story-telling!It's an excellent book that I highly recommend. "," It started off quite lovely. But I soon became tired of Wickham and Lydia and Georgiana.  I wanted more Darcy and Elizabeth. I didn't like this version of GD. She was too much like Lydia. "," This is my new favorite JAFF tale.  Great plot that flows well from frame to frame.  Unlike any part of canon, the story begins in Kent, Elizabeth is travelling with her aunt and uncle on a holiday.  During a ramble with a maid she comes upon a man with a gun who is waiting for someone to come down the road.  From this beginning she almost dies.  Darcy picks her up and gets her to medical care.  The man with the gun was George Wickham who was trying to keep Darcy from interfering with the elope with Georgiana.  Both he and Mr Bennet feel that Elizabeth has been compromised and Darcy offers marriage.Well written and edited, the characters are portrayed as they should be and the dialog is very believable.  There is no small amount of angst dealing with Lizzy's near death at Wickham's hand, the marriage, Lydia and Lady Catherine.  All in all a rousing  tale. Recommended "

Her father’s words were easy enough to catch, but her mother’s shrill voice was garbled and beginning to give Lizzy a headache. While twisting her head between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the tears began to spill from her eyes and down her cheeks.Sitting on the settee next to Elizabeth, her elder sister and dearest friend and companion Jane Bennet, took her hand in support. “Mama,” Jane interjected, “Lizzy attending the local assemblies has never been an issue before. Why should she not attend the autumn assemble this evening?”“Because, Jane dearest, we have never had a wealthy and eligible new neighbor attending our local assembly before. Mr. Bingley must be given only the very best impression of you and our family. We can’t have your sister embarrassing us the first time he meets you.”With her mother’s more subdued speech and her turning to face Jane, and thus herself, Lizzy was able to understand each painful word that Mrs. Bennet had spoken. Blinking away the tears and turning her head, she looked directly at Jane before acquiescing to her mother’s demands. “It will be fine, Janie. Papa says he is an affable young man, and Charlotte Lucas says that Sir William reports that he is also handsome. Mama is right. You will make a splendid impression on him.

Elizabeth had an amazing advocate in the person of her father who saw that she was prepared to live with her difficulty.  She was able to succeed in all of her endeavors.

Elizabeth had a hearing disability but she learnt to cope with life. Darcy fell in love without much angst and then, the challenge was getting married. I couldn’t understand why Mrs Bennet would let Lizzy keep rich Darcy company, instead of her other daughters. I wish the disability angle had been explored more, both for Elizabeth and overall.

But Elizabeth has lost much of her hearing, and this was a time when families sometimes hid disabled children away in asylums.

I did enjoy the plot. "," This variation is remarkable because Elizabeth Bennet is depicted as one who has a physical disability or ailment; yet she refuses to let that faze her.  She is stronger, yet less prideful and prejudice towards other.  She can easily forgive even when wronged.Another remarkable element is the Christian message and Bible passage featured herein. A most fitting reference to what Elizabeth Bennet goes through.What made this variation less appealing is the fairy tale approach to it.  Fitzwilliam Darcy is too good to be true somewhat.  Overindulgent and overly affectionate to Elizabeth, which is rather unusual to be negative.  But that is how it read.  There is no angst to speak of except for cruelty from Mrs. Bennet and Lady Catherine,  who gets easily dismissed in a few lines.  Even Caroline Bingley’s attempts are half-baked and lackluster. She one has too much of a good thing, it gets rather unappealing.Nevertheless, there will be fans of JAFF who will appreciate this kind of fairy tale variation, which this reader rates 3 1/2 stars rounded down to 3.

"," A worthwhile read, this will definitely appeal to all P&P fans who love alluring variations which depict Elizabeth Bennet as one who is not only kind, intelligent and courageous but also a go-getter, one who doesn’t wait for others to dictate her fate and find solutions to problems that affect herself and her family, and yet aware and accepting enough of her status/position in life.  It is easy enough to think how the seemingly fastidious Fitzwilliam Darcy fell hard for her. This reader also love the way Mr. Darcy is depicted here.  Although he may seem so full of himself at the beginning, the story dwells on how he reached to that point and how he works to better himself, enough to win the affection and heart of Elizabeth Bennet.What make this story remarkable are: how both the leads slowly but surely falls for each other even at so short a time with endearing and sweet exchanges, how the author makes use of geography and historical circumstances and events that brings about the inevitable conclusion of the beloved couple, and how secondary characters of Canon are given a more sinister and/or negative characterizations.One can’t help but fall in love with and swoon to Elizabeth Bennet’s and Mr. Darcy’s journey to love as they travail the waters that endanger their lives and limbs and that of others dependent upon them.This is definitely one of this author’s well-written and thought-out stories that won’t fail to impress. "," While the theme was enjoyable, and I enjoyed the interactions with the twins and the flow of the story was fine, I had several issues with the plot. Starting with: Why would Darcy put Georgiana into the power of an uncle he despises? I don't believe Darcy would.At the assembly, 1) Minor: Elizabeth is going to control her family. Then she leaves their spot when Mrs Long and Mrs Goulding's gossip gets to be too much for her. (But looks like her resolutions do not last long.) 2) Darcy had to turn around to see Elizabeth. It seems unlikely to me he would have then answered Bingley without turning back to face him, so how could Elizabeth then catch his eye to acknowledge his insult?Exactly HOW are they going marry by the next day? You cannot do that with a common license and must go to London to obtain a special license. And Darcy is barely well enough to travel to Longbourn. And there had not been enough time to call the banns as far as I know.Minor: Mrs Bennet knows they are in dire financial straights, so where is the money for a lavish entertainment to come from? Though knowing about it isn't likely to stop her thinking she can do it.""The bruises at her jaw and temple had faded to slight shadows."" Has it even been a week? If there had been enough time to call the banns, that would work for fading bruises but that isn't going to be the case because Darcy is lying low, letting the world presume him dead or missing.Lastly, maybe the Prince can do whatever he wants but would he really decide to ruin a powerful, longtime friend on just the word of two strangers related by blood to that friend? If they will be tainted by Matlock's ruin, doesn't that make their integrity suspect, so oughtn't the prince have someone else investigate their claims? And they do to the Viscount what the Earl did to all those other people, so two wrongs make a right? "

A P&P re-imagining that has Charlotte Lucas married to Mr Bennett's younger half brother, who is a talented artist. This artist uncle has instructed his two eldest nieces, so Jane is an accomplished sculptor and wood carver, and Elizabeth is accomplished at sketching. Her sketches provide Jane and her uncle with subjects for their endeavors. In this version, all five Bennett daughters are intelligent and responsible, and each has her own special talent. However, Mr Bennett is dying, and Mrs Bennett is cartoonishly silly and annoying. Fortunately, when Mr Bennett dies, Longbourn passes to his younger brother and Charlotte.Into this situation comes the Bingleys, Hursts, and Darcy, but Darcy also brings Fitzwilliam and Georgiana. Darcy delivers his infamous insult at the Meryton assembly, but Fitzwilliam, as his ""handler"", has him apologizing soon thereafter.  Jane has a lot more backbone, Mary is less pompous, Kitty is still strangely fragile, but she's proud of her angora rabbits, and Lydia, although still lively, is more mature and not at all selfish.The death of Mr Bennett, and the effect on the family, is the main focus. Wickham has a role as a villain,  but since the Bennett daughters are all well behaved, his impact is indirect. I would say Mrs Bennett is the worst dilemma faced by the family, but that's only due to her extreme stupidity. This author is always strong with the religious references, and in this book it's particularly evident. It very nearly crossed the line into preachiness, but not quite. The book is well written and well edited. I recommend it for an interesting and imaginative story, with lovely romance. "," I always enjoy stories where the Bennet sisters have strong personalities and are united in purpose (and always happy to see a forthright Jane). Here we see them working together to take care of each other, manage their mother, deal with Wickham, and make decisions that lead to their own happiness. This story had some emotional moments regarding Mr Bennet and his health that were well done and affecting, and many of the interactions between the sisters and “villains” of the story were entertaining. Where the story fell a bit flat was the romance. I enjoyed Jane’s a bit more than Elizabeth’s, maybe because Darcy — except in his dealings with Wickham—seemed a lukewarm, milquetoast character at best. A decent guy but hardly an ardent one.But I enjoyed the story overall. Nitpicks might be that Kitty completely disappears in the epilogue, which was odd, and I’ve never seen the word “impecunious” appear so many times in a book before; so often it was incredibly distracting. "," This author has become a must read for me. And this book did not disappoint at all! It was a lovely read.  One of the things I liked most was the realistic feel of it. There were no overdrawn caricatures here. The varying family interactions were great and the children perfection. The little scene in the prologue of Jane's family. . .🥰  Not everyone can write children into the story and make them seem perfect in all their imperfections.  I really appreciate a good story where the sisters are close, and the drama isn't focused around Lydia/Whickam. I also really appreciate a good story where Whickam is justly taken care of. This book had a great ending for Whickam.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good Pride and Prejudice variation that stays clean and isn't the normal status quo. "," First the author asked for 5 star reviews in her afterward which I found off putting. Here are 4 stars despite that, author.I enjoyed this even though it was VERY religious. I know the author is a Christian and that can influence her books but there was a lot.There were also LONG passages of sonnets, excerpts from various Shakespeare plays (yes, more than one) the Bible and way too much of the wedding ceremony which I’m not sure was from The Book of Common Prayer which would have been used in Regency times. At least I noticed fewer anachronisms than I saw in previous work.Very long epilogue: three chapters!  I don’t know who Kitty married but I think she did marry.I enjoyed the storyline of the new heir to Longbourn and the endeavors of the Bennet daughters. "," Do not need to have read original P&P to get this book. Liked that Mr. Bennet had a brother. Did not miss Mr. Collins.  Wickham, Caroline, and CDB were neatly handled.  This author actually gives Jane a voice and lydia a purpose, but Kitty & Mary were glossed over.  Gardiner's were not really part of this story. I always deduct a star when an author keeps Elizabeth as Mr. Bennet's favorite (why? Not necessary for plot) and Mary being paired with curate/vicar.  Too easy/predictable. Good read. Added to my P&P Collection. "," I have enjoyed many of this authors works but this is in my opinion her best.  These characters have so much depth, the plot is an interesting variation, the villains” are not caricatures.  What if Mr. Bennet had a younger brother? What if Jane really had a back bone? What if Mr. Bennet encouraged all his daughters to pursue some kind of talent?  If all that happened you would get this lovely story.  A great escape for a lazy afternoon.  I highly recommend you buy or borrow this soon. "," I enjoyed reading this variation.  It had many storylines and then just skipped Kitty’s story.However it was a good read.  If you are a grammar nut — this has few a errors.  Too many epilogues.I do recommend this sweet read. "," Mr. Bennet dies and it was quite a moving experience. High angst. Other than that the angst was low. Jane and Bingley have a novel story arc. All in all a quiet and pleasant read. "

I enjoyed it from beginning to 'end'.What I liked:- Elizabeth has misunderstandings and doubts about Darcy, but not enough to want to strangle her for being obtuse.- Darcy wasn't a coward, and actually admitted his feelings for Elizabeth early on instead of leaving Elizabeth in the dark.- Bingley takes charge of his household.- Caroline, no waiting until the end- I'm able to enjoy little set downs along the way.- The better Bennets.Now that I'm writing my review, I realize there isn't anything I didn't like. "," This would be a good book for someone not familiar with the original story.  After reading over a hundred p&ps I almost didn't read after the first few pages but the style of writing is good and the Title tempted me to finish and I'm happy I did. Everyone but poor Mr Wickham and Caroline had a turn around of personality, and enough of a mix up to make for a fun story and plan to read the sequel with its published. "," This story does not depart far from canon. Yes, as the cover shows there is a slap involved. I have to add (as no one warned me) that there is mention of more than one ""rape"" in this story. No details but as the ""girls"" were underage it is statutory rape even if they consented. (You must know who is the perpetrator.)Caroline Bingley goes over the edge in her determination to not only ""have"" Mr. Darcy but then in also attempting to ruin the woman he falls for. Charles Bingley has a backbone in not only handling her but also in determining his own path to love.Mr. Collins was a nice surprise. The author even has him taking a bath at one point. (I mention this, as in some stories he is presented as a man with greasy hair and body odor.) His viewpoint about Lady Catherine was especially surprising and realistic. Of course, Lady Catherine does show up to present her viewpoint but in this story her brother is there to help set her down.Mr. Bennet decides to come out of his study and take charge of his family. Elizabeth has been helping by managing the estate but he now determines to take steps to put it back on better financial ground. He also sends his two youngest back to the nursery. It takes some very dramatic events before Lydia accepts what everyone has been telling her about Wickham.One event in the story involves Elizabeth using her throwing skills learned as she played games with boys growing up. Her aim with an apple is forceful and accurate and very much needed!This does come to a FMS for Darcy and Elizabeth but the story ends before Darcy can woe and win Elizabeth's admiration much less his love. He spends much of the story attempting to find a way to apologize to Elizabeth for that insult at the Assembly and other words she overhears. While Elizabeth is very determined not to believe anything good about Darcy.This story needs editing. Besides spelling errors and sentence structure problems there is also some awkward wording. I did enjoy the story but for me there was not enough new material. It was rather an expanding of much of canon. I have borrowed the sequel from KU and will read it next. "," Who would have thought that Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy would lose his composure.  After all it is what defines him and is what we know about him.  In this P & P variation that is what happened.  He is brought low by Miss Elizabeth Bennet a daughter of a country gentleman.  The story follows canon in that Mr. Bingley leases Netherfield Park, they attend the Meryton Assembly, and that he insults Elizabeth.  Other similarities are also noted however there are considerable differences.  Miss Caroline Bingley in this story is very different.  Mr. Wickham in this version is far worst and because of this Mr. Bennet is forced to make changes to his role as the patriarch of his family.  Mr. Collins Mr Bennet's heir is not what we expect. Neither is Lady Catherine de Bourgh or her daughter Anne.  The Bennets and the inhabitants of Netherfield Park are invited to the dinner party at Lucas Lodge.  It also proceeds accordingly except Darcy had been trying to apologize to Elizabeth for his slight for a long time and this has cost him a great deal of frustration because she has been avoiding him.  So when Sir William asks Elizabeth to dance with Mr. Darcy she refuses as is canon but instead of letting her go, he grabs her and kisses her most ardently in front of everyone.  After a very deserving slap Darcy and Elizabeth are betrothed.  So they must marry.  From here the story continues with other betrothals, family interferences, dangers, betrayals, madness, intrigues as well as marriage.  What's not to love?  Great story that ends in a continuation.  Can't wait to read it! "," The plot is canon enough to considered a variation  and is appreciated by this reader for not being so close to the original that the majority of the story is not truly varied,  but  is  instead so very familiar to me  that I find myself flipping page after page to find what's novel in the story.Unfortunately, there is the dreaded ""however,"" to continue.  The book needs better editing ,  both  with respect to content and grammar. Some sections  would be improved with fleshing out.  Some sentences could be smoother.  But I did enjoy the story enough to look forward to the continuation, particularly if my suggestions are considered. Please know that I make them as a very experienced professional editor of various genres but largely Pride and Prejudice variations, well over a hundred, well-rated, even award winning.  (And no, I'm not looking for new clients.)  I think this story has more potential than is expressed in this volume. So, please keep writing.Note: If there are errors in this comment, I apologize.

But what if family business required him to stay at Rosings after giving her his letter? In this passion-filled variation, coming face to face with Mr. Darcy only days later could give Elizabeth a new chance to understand him... or a chance for even more misunderstandings.

Her hobbies do not include sleeping or cleaning her house."," I gave in to temptation and ordered all five of these Pride and Prejudice variations at one time.  I have been allowing some time to elapse between reading each book because basically they are all telling the same story, just with ""variations"".  From this point on, there is information in my review which some may consider spoilers.This book, BY FORCE OF INSTINCT, was well written and pleasant to read.  I have rated it with three stars because it just did not rise to the level of a four star book for me consistently enough.  I enjoyed it but I also began to lose patience with it and wondered why the author continued to write when she had essentially solved the problem for the two main characters.Our story begins just after Elizabeth Bennet has read the letter from Fitzwilliam Darcy explaining his feelings and misgivings about her and the true happenings between his family and Wickham.  Elizabeth is mortified to know that she has misjudged Darcy so terribly and just wants to retreat into some private place to recover emotionally from what she now knows.  But she will not be allowed to do that.  Due to family commitments Darcy is unable to leave Rosings Park immediately as he had planned.  He has to stay on for another week and he and Elizabeth are together frequently.  It is an extremely trying time for both of them.All of the Reynolds ""variations"" are explorations of what might have happened to these two people if just one circumstance had changed.  In this book Elizabeth and Darcy are thrown together enough after ""the letter"" to give them a chance to view each other more realistically.  I was actually fine with the book until it began to portray characters in such completely unfamiliar roles that they made me uncomfortable.  Georgiana is an insecure, spoiled brat.  I realize that she is a 16 year old girl but in those times she was old enough to be considered eligible for marriage so this was not a favorable aspect of her personality for me.  She does something spiteful which causes a huge problem for Elizabeth and Darcy.  Too much character deviation for my taste.  Mr. Bennet makes a conscious effort to dislike Darcy, even after Elizabeth tries desperately to convince him of her love for Darcy and his innate goodness.  I didn't understand Mr. Bennet's pigheadedness and the author didn't help me understand.  Once again, too much character deviation for my taste.  Elizabeth's Uncle Gardner played a pivitol role in the engagement but he was shown to be a very harsh, stern, immoveable person.  Yet again, too much character deviation for my taste.And now we come to the sexual content of the book.  Never, in my wildest dreams would I imagine Elizabeth Bennet initiating a sexual encounter with Fitzwilliam Darcy but that is exactly what this book portrays her as doing.  And from then until the final pages of the book it is just one time after another of the author describing these characters trying to keep their hands off each other and not always succeeding.  Okay, this is not Pride and Prejudice, this is a story written by another author, b-u-t I didn't like this aspect of the book.  One incident, maybe. On and on, no.  They do get married I'm glad to say but that just seemed to reveal Darcy as being totally insecure.  I wasn't prepared for him to need so much reassuring by Elizabeth that she loved him.  And this book just contains one misunderstanding after another (indulged in equally by both characters which at least made it different from other romances).My bottom line is this:  if you enjoy reading historical romantic fiction, you will like this book.  If you are a stickler for the straight and narrow Pride and Prejudice, you will not like this book.  If you find yourself somewhere in between, you will enjoy parts of it and get really frustrated (and bored) by other parts of it.  Three stars?  Yes, it went up to a four star level sometimes and dipped down to a two star level during other portions.  I did the math and came up with three stars! "," The writing is good, but I was frustrated during the first half of the book. I thought of giving up a few times. My issue was with Darcy and Elizabeth. The MOST these two can go without some misunderstanding, cutting words, or doubt was 24 hours. Many times it took place within a visit. They will come to some form of friendliness, then the next thing you know someone is angry or over thinking someone's look, or whatever. Elizabeth responds to Darcy's kiss, then exclaims  ""How dare you!"" They get engaged, next day drama. They kiss again...drama. I didn't get it. If it didn't happen so often the book would have been quite enjoyable.What I did like:-Darcy's devotion (early on I thought, why should he bother?)-The author did a great job showing Darcy vulnerability, almost child-like.-Elizabeth's character- once she decided to trust Darcy completely. In my opinion, Elizabeth became Darcy's protector and comforter.-I know many people who feel like Pride and Prejudice variations has to have Elizabeth going to Pemberley. That wasn't the case in this book. Pemberley was mentioned, but the author didn't focus on that. Instead, in my opinion, she focused on Darcy and Elizabeth relationship. The need for Darcy to feel loved without Pemberley and all of his wealth. Elizabeth reassuring Darcy that all she needs is him. With that being said, Darcy and Elizabeth intimate moments on screen wasn't the fairytale, romantic, wine and dine experience. What I got instead was Darcy and Elizabeth need for the other, that all outside noise, customs, and expectations meant nothing if they didn't have each other. Of course, there's a chance Darcy and Elizabeth have rubbed off on me and I'm over thinking this, so be it. "," Let me start by saying that the Pemberly variations series has nearly cost me my eyesight.  I have been reading them back-to-back in recent days.  Far be it from me to complain about the books, as I have throughly enjoyed being back in Darcy and Elizabeth's world.  Mrs. Reynolds writes very much in the style of Miss Austen, and is to be commended for attempting probe, speculate, elaborate on and suggest different ""paths"" for the inhabitants of P & P.That said, I must warn that the actions of the main characters in this story are not particularly consistent with Miss Austen's representation of the principles they act upon in the original work. Of course, it is true that many novels of that time depict the kind of barely-contained passion that Mrs. Reynolds invents for Lizzy and Darcy.  I just find it troubling to imagine them acting on impulses which, in P & P are barely referred to, and frowned upon as representing weakness and selfishiness.  It is possible that Miss Austen would like to have been free to say more about the feelings and desires of Darcy and Elizabeth, but it was not to be.  Had she had that freedom, however, I believe Elizabeth would have chosen to keep her virtue all the way to the altar.  In fact, it is precisely that aspect of the story, the character and principles of Elizabeth Bennet, that led to her being my heroine and the example I called upon in my younger years as the ideal feminine strength.But back to the real world, (where I found my hero with much less propriety than Lizzy), I did enjoy the sexual tension and more descriptive language provided to the lovers as they explored their feelings and conflicts.  So, if you are one of the so-called purists, you may find the sexual component of this what-if scenario not to your liking.  But if you find you cannot get enough of this story, even find yourself reading the poorly-reviewed sequels just to get another look at the characters, then you must read this, and all of Mrs. Reynolds' variations.  They are entertaining, upsetting, frustrating, heartwarming and sometimes shocking.  But they are very enjoyable and satisfying vehicles for entering that world I so adore. "

But, of note, is that for me, there was little resemble to Cinderella. Yes, there is a wicked stepmother, but she is not stepmother to any of the Bennet sisters. There are two women who try to compromise Darcy, but that is hardly new as Caroline Bingley can be counted on in many stories to take on that role. There are no stepsisters although Elizabeth does come to treat her charge as a ""sister"" in caring for and trying to protect her. Elizabeth does get to dance with Darcy/the prince, but it is as their relationship finally shows all that they are a ""couple"".Jane and the Gardiners have promised Elizabeth that they will reveal to no one her employment as a governess, as society would then forever see her status as lowered to the working class and any chance of a good marriage would be out the door.Darcy and Bingley have returned to Netherfield to seek the hands of the two Bennet sisters and find the Collinses have inherited Longbourn upon Mr. Bennet's death. There is no room for all the family to move in with the Phillipses so Jane and Elizabeth have moved in with the Gardiners with the idea that they will both seek a position as governesses. The Gardiners decide to hire Jane to care for their children in that role. Elizabeth finds a role with a Countess Bremont who turns out to be hiding her insolvency and plans to sell her stepdaughter to the highest bidder. Elizabeth is forced to keep a very tight agenda in her role as governess, not even being allowed outside to walk...unless she takes a maid and then does all the work the maid is missing as she chaperones Elizabeth and her charge, Madeleine. She has no days or even hours ""off"" and is usually too tired to read. Oddly, she receives no return letters to the ones she sends to Jane and the Gardiners.Thus, Darcy is forced to spend time and money seeking Elizabeth. She does not know his role in saving Lydia but rather thinks that he rushed off from Lambton due to the family's disgrace and his wanting nothing more to do with her.I highly recommend this story but note that the ""voice"" is sometimes awkward and there is some editing needed. "," Interesting variation. Written in a more modern style for P & P. A bit of mad cap adventure with more confusion at times. Definitely a very light read. "," This variation is quite interesting but has some consistent problems in editing. One is the use of 'her' instead of 'she' when the subject is in the middle of the sentence.There were e few others, but not as glaring. On the other hand, the storyline was good. The telling intriguing, and P&P addicts like me will enjoy the nail biting suspense. The ending is abrupt, though. "," I really like Bella breen's work. Her characters are always fully flushed out at her plots are always Light And breezy with just a hint of danger "," This was one where Elizabeth is strong and just as determined to save herself as well as a girl with a evil step mother. "," This story is fun, continuously moving forward.  A little mystery, but our favorite characters are stretching their muscles a little.  Not canon but it certainly is entertaining.  Would recommend it to those who don't want to read a recreation of the original.  It is fun to read JA's characters branch out some.  It was refreshing to read a Jane not so passive.  She steps up her character. "," This story had a little of  many different feeling aspects within. The emotional pull you feel for characters is intense. I truly was surprised at how awful Caroline was, but ecstatic for how Mr Darcy handled her. Elizabeth was awesome throughout the whole story. Loved how Darcy and Elizabeth came together. Poor Lady  Madeline, her stepmother sucked. Thank goodness Lady Madeline was saved from her. Highly recommended for all to read "," This book was very enjoyable especially with regards to the love that Darcy has for Elizabeth and how he searches all of London to find her. I look forward to reading more by this author. "

The inheritor of her husband’s estate, Netherfield Park, Elizabeth is now a wealthy young widow, independent and self-reliant. With an eye always on improving her four sisters’ woefully small dowries and providing for her mother, who will be homeless when her father dies, Elizabeth is pleased to lease out Netherfield to the Bingley family from the north of England, making her home in the dower house in Meryton and vowing that she will never remarry.Fitzwilliam Darcy of Pemberley in Derbyshire is rich and well-connected, but reserved in company with anybody outside the very few he counts as friends. Towards those friends, he is loyal and steadfast, the staunchest of supporters. So when a young man comes to him with a tale of the clandestine marriage and mysterious death of Darcy’s old schoolfriend, James Grayson, and begs Darcy’s help to investigate the widow’s role, Darcy agrees. Visiting Charles Bingley, the new tenant of Netherfield, Darcy is very soon torn between his loyalty to his dead friend, and his burgeoning attraction to the widow.Throw two unprincipled rogues and an elopement into the confines of Meryton, and how will Darcy’s dilemma over Elizabeth ever be resolved?

The characters true to the original. In some ways, I actually prefer this to the original. However, this is essentially a retelling of the original. I was almost 200 pages in when I realized the author was going to tell the same story with tweaks. If I had gotten the book from KU, I would have stopped reading it and returned it regardless of how well it was written, but I paid for it.I read the variations to see how creative an author can be with the original framework. So, I am disappointed and wasted time and money. I do recommend the book to others who prefer their variations not to stray from canon. I however, want to see how creative an author can be writing in this “universe”. Four stars for a well written book. One star deducted for less than stellar creativity. "," There are parts of this story that are lifted from P&P, some that are changed around to fit into new places and different characters, and other parts that are completely original to this story. There are some new characters and most of the ones we remember from the original. Lizzy is at her witty, biting best, but also with a terribly vulnerable underside because of what she has gone through. I love how the whole town supports her and loves her, and how she bands together with her uncles and father to rescue Lydia. Mr. Darcy is not too lovable in the beginning. In addition to being proud and haughty, he seems trapped into continuing on a course he is beginning to think is wrong. He also seems incapable of doing anything about Wickham…but that is fairly standard in these P& P variations. He turns it around somewhere in the middle, and offers Lizzy a most beautiful proposal at the end. That’s not really a spoiler because we expect a HEA in these stories. I should also mention that Lizzy delivers some pretty amazing set-downs in this story…all deserved of course, even if not totally proper. It’s always great to hear Lizzy say to Caroline what we all wish we could tell her. "," This is a beautifully written variation, full of so much heart and pain and redemption. The story is compelling and heart-wrenching. Though it follows many of the major plot points of the original, it does so in wildly different ways, with circumstances and motivations that are both startlingly different yet achingly familiar. Without giving too much away, I found Mr. Hurst to be a particular gem in the supporting cast. (Also look out for the Lucas men to shine in their own ways!) "," There's nothing wrong with this book. But it didn't excite me either. I will say that the author's use of language is quite skilled, and she manages the regency grammar and syntax quite well. But grammar and syntax aren't everything, and I found myself skipping over many pages of description -- sometimes several pages of description for one silent thought. And I can even accept that if there's enough romance between ODC to satisfy me. But alas, there was a lot more hinting than swooning here. I'm still not sorry I read it; the author's facility with language and knowledge of the history of the period still made it a nice respite from reality. "," I sincerely hope that this author continues to create wonderful works such as Mistress of Netherfield.  Elizabeth Bennett is forced into an abusive marriage at age sixteen, and widowed six months later.  She inherits Netherfield Park from her late husband, as well as the dower house, Nether House, where she lives while leasing the main residence. The Bingleys arrive, along with a brother of Elizabeth's late husband masquerading as Darcy's personal secretary. This brother is trying to discover if the widow had something to do with his late brother's death, and he's a sinister presence.This story isn't for the faint of heart.  Some details of the abuse endured by Elizabeth are eventually disclosed, and while highly disturbing, it's handled well and isn't needlessly gory.  It is, however, highly affecting, and should be warned about.  This is an Elizabeth that you'll admire for her strength, and want to give a hug to, because you can see as you read the story that she's headed for further difficulties at the hands of none other than Mr Darcy.This writer is superb, and she creates such beautiful prose.  What a pleasure to read a truly good book, with an interesting premise, infused with gentle humor, and absolutely absorbing.  All the usual villains are included, with the surprise addition of Mr Darcy and his pretend secretary.  It's a pretty gut wrenching road to HEA for ODC.  The story is heartbreaking and heartwarming, horrifying and romantic, suspenseful and exciting.I almost deducted a star for three reasons.  One:  no epilogue.  It needed one.  Two:  Mr Darcy's shocking agreement to participate in a deception - just not at all like him.  Three:  I didn't want the book to end.  However, given the quality of the book, and how much enjoyment it gave, it's definitely worthy of five stars.  It's well written, well edited, and is an uplifting story.  I recommend it highly. "," This book was wonderful from start to finish, without losing the storyline of the original. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I was unable to put this book down. Well done. "

Growing up, she would listen to her siblings’ tales of shenanigans and escapades. Although she did not share her older siblings daring quest for adventure, she did discover that through imagination she could find all the excitement she craved from the safety of her room. She discovered a love of reading at a young age and firmly believed that a good book should strive to make the reader feel uplifted. She was later shocked to find that nearly every English teacher she would study under disagreed with this philosophy. After countless hours reading assigned novels that included tragedies, melodramas, and modernism, Cinnamon was eventually convinced to admit that a good book does not require a happy ending. She does, however, strongly advocate for one.In college, Cinnamon met her Prince Charming and then promptly left him to pursue an opportunity to study abroad in the beautiful English countryside. Fortunately, her Prince was a patient man who waited for her return, and he has since spent nearly 25 years teaching her the meaning of love, showing her the World, helping her to raise two wonderful children, and encouraging her to pursue her dreams. Cinnamon enjoyed a long career in public sector finance, but she was delighted to leave the corporate world behind in 2014 to focus her efforts on being a homemaker. This shift gave her more time to explore new interests and hobbies which include traveling, cake decorating, crafting, and home renovations. Much to her surprise, she discovered, almost by chance, that she also loved to write. Hoping to encourage her own children to embrace reading, Cinnamon started writing stories that she thought would cater to their preferences. She focused on plots that centered around characters her children admired. Although she was informed by her children that her stories were, “good but contained too many words,” Cinnamon found an audience for her work after posting the stories on the internet. Soon, Cinnamon decided to shift her focus to writing stories based on some of her own favorite characters. For now, these include Jane Austin’s most beloved characters."," This P&P variation was imaginative and humorous. I found myself laughing out loud several times as I read. The misunderstandings were the cause of much confusion and despair, making the true understanding all the more encouraging for the characters. We know the characters very well from the original text, but the author gives us a different perspective. It’s a challenge to come up with another variation of the original, but I think Cinnamon Worth managed to write a creative alternative. It was a fun read.I had a difficult time with the dialogue, which I found unnatural. I just don’t think people talked to each other so formally. It gave me the impression that the author was trying to have the characters speak like they would back in that period, but she missed the mark in my opinion.Overall I liked this book and recommend it to all P&P fans.Note: I do NOT recommend the Audible version. The narrator is not pleasant to listen to and detracts from the book. I received an audio review copy from the author, but purchased the kindle version which i found more enjoyable. "," A light-hearted, funny and engaging read.As rumours reached Darcy and Bingley, that a Bennet sister was marrying the heir of Longbourn, they immediately set out for Netherfield to see if the bride was any of their lady love.I do not reveal too much by admitting it was Mary who was the ""lucky"" bride but the bachelors does meet some other obstacles on their way to HEA. Jane had grown a backbone and was not easily persuaded. Elizabeth had some suiters, seeking her attention and assumptions was made, leading Darcy to heartbreak for all the wrong reasons. It took him a while and the most hilarious proposal ever, to come to the conclusion that Elizabeth did not like him very much...The book had me laughing out loud on several occasions, both proposals being the highlights of the book.Heartily recommend! "," I missed Caroline and George but a different twist on ED and FD's misinterpreting and not asking for clarification was interesting.  I enjoyed this author. "," He's kind of like a bull in a China shop...messing up everything he tries.  He behaves in an immature, pouty way....kind of a jerk instead of the wonderful person Bingley and Georgiana believe him to be. It's hard to feel sympathy for him. His proposal is abysmal and he is clueless as to what he has done  wrong.  Even though I was sure there would be a HEA somewhere down the line, it was a long time coming and there was a lot of time to dislike Mr. Darcy. On the other hand, his second proposal was outstanding and the last 2 chapters were wonderful. Just read those. "," How can things get and more mixed up? This is a really diverting and absurd comedy and Darcy takes the prize! "," Wow, this was a jarring mish-mash of ideas. Mrs. Bennet is fiercely protective of her daughters, even Elizabeth! Darcy trips over his own tongue, offending rather than pleasing, but suddenly turns eloquently romantic  as soon as E says yes she'll marry him.It stretches the imagination that Jane and Bingley would not have insisted upon helping the Bennets financially after Mr. Bennet is believed dead. To have Elizabeth work for a living would have been a point of shame for them. Turning Elizabeth into a politically correct feminist does no one any favors, least of all fans of historical fiction.A new character is introduced to be the villain, who aims to eliminate Mr. Bennet and plunge the family into poverty. An overly elaborate plot is put into place, which seems unnecessary. The excuse is that the villain wants to make Mr. Bennet suffer tremendously. I couldn't help but think it would have served better, and cost the villain less money, time and trouble, to simply arrange for him to be shipped to New South Wales (Australia/penal colony). Bennet would have suffered more, with no way to rescue him. Much more suitable an ending, from a villain's standpoint. So the author's overly complicated plot rings a false bell.It's little details like this that when examined, make little or poor sense in the story. Elizabeth re-arranging Darcy's library books without asking/telling Georgiana, is silly, for another example. She's trying to help Darcy's sister find a gift for him, so it only makes sense for her to involve G's interest and help. Why try to surprise G? There's absolutely no point in it. To claim that E didn't want to raise expectations, is illogical. Trying to make it a secret from everybody, then having Darcy discover what E did and lose his temper, is a forced and awkward piece of writing that lacks believability. It makes E look dumb rather than impulsive, detracting from the author's portrait of her.These types of niggling defects lessen the enjoyment, and thus the low rating. Angst can be acceptable when well-written, but here too much of it is put in for melodrama's sake. It makes the pacing uneven, and our beloved P&P characters do not show to best advantage here. "," I call it a ""mixed bag"" because the plot, characterizations and style were enjoyable and compelling (uncommon praise for a P&P variation) but the grammar, specifically the outrageous overuse of commas, was annoying to say the least. Unwarranted separations within phrases created awkward and confusing flow within sentences, sometimes making it difficult to interpret meaning. Also, word omissions had me constantly filling in obviously missing ones, distracting from following the storyline.What I don't understand is where in the process from the author's ""pen"" to the downloaded electronic book all this grammatical mess occurred. I would very much like to know. "," Not a perfect book but far better than most.  Caught and held my attention straight through to the end.  Liked the slightly different, but faithful to canon, take on Mrs. Bennet. "

There's angst in at least eighty percent of this book. I don't want to tell much but I did cry in more than one occasion. However sadness I felt this book is really good. I really enjoyed reading it. "," An unusual pair of villains in this JAFF. One we expect - Wickham - but the other we do not. Mary Bennet has married cousin Mr. Collins, but the inheritance of Longbourn has brought out the worst in husband and wife. Jane is married to a stock trader, living in London and popping out babies. Kitty is mostly at sea with her husband, who commands a ship in the Royal Navy.The widowed Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are stuck at Longbourn, suffering the self-righteous moralizing and unkind remarks of the Collinses. Elizabeth spends half the year with Jane and half the year at Longbourn. She is endlessly criticized in both places - a faded, useless spinster with no marital prospects but must be financially supported by her brothers-in-law. All the joy has left Elizabeth's life: her father is dead, every activity she took pleasure in, is restricted or found fault with by unpleasant people she is forced to propitiate or obey.This is not the lively, spirited Elizabeth of Austen's canon. Everything that could go wrong for the Bennets, has happened to this Elizabeth. She is still clever, perceptive, kind and generous. But for years she has lived under the thumb of people intent upon grinding her down, every day. It has taken its inevitable toll upon her spirits. There is little laughter in her now, no matter where she lives.In this story, Bingley never rented Netherfield, although he and Darcy briefly visited it as a possibility. When Darcy needs a place to hide from everyone who knows him or Georgiana, he remembers the modest lodge on Netherfield's estate, and rents it. His chilly reserve and Georgiana's complete withdrawal from any social activities lead to slanderous gossip about them in Meryton society.When Elizabeth forms a friendship with Georgiana, it leads to Darcy facing a situation he couldn't have expected, as well as a truth he never wanted to face. Those who are fans of seeing as much of Elizabeth and Darcy as possible, will enjoy this story. Gone are Miss Bingley and the de Bourghs, and even Wickham is only briefly on-scene. The tumultuous relationship of ODC is front and foremost here.A large plus to this story is a short scene between Darcy and one of the Bennet sisters. He opens a small gift from foolish, vulgar Mrs. Bennet – and what he finds inside shakes him to the core. Just as the disastrous Hunsford proposal sends canon's Darcy reeling, so does Mrs. Bennet's package make this Darcy realize how terribly wrong his judgment was.This is one of the most unique JAFFs I've read. Despite the pathos and tragedy that shadow ODC's relationship, the heroines (there is more than one in this story) insist upon looking forward, not dwelling on the past. One feels this Darcy could easily become a man forever looking backwards. It is the women in his life who truly do save him.Highly recommended for all P&P fans who don't mind a touch of tragedy with their HEAs. "," I read this book, prepared for angst and tragedy. I got both, Mr Bennet is dead and his family is left to fend for themselves. All the girls except Lizzy and Lydia are married. Elizabeth, in this story, is not frolicking about, laughing at everything. She is depressed, angry and lonely. Darcy and Georgiana (I’ll call her GD) are in the neighbourhood, Lizzy ends up befriending GD. I could swallow and even empathise with Lizzy’s situation. But GD’s was beyond me. What were they even doing in Meryton? Darcy was rich and well connected, they could have gone in the wilderness with servants, if they wanted. Lizzy doesn’t know about Darcy’s status and wealth for most of the book, which means his arrogance and horrible manners have no excuse. I couldn’t stand him and was relieved that he began to change halfway through. I wish that the climax had come earlier, I was more interested in the aftermath of Darcy and Lizzy’s marriage. I liked how the Bennets, including Lizzy, were portrayed in this book. It was interesting and believable. The Darcys, not so much "," I felt badly for so many of our favorites as this began. What a distribution of misfortune!Engaged from the beginning, I appreciated the flow and character development of this variation. Even if I fully comprehended Elizabeth's malady early on, the tension totally worked for me.Canon traits were well represented and surprises were effective.Well done. "," Miss Elizabeth Bennet knew her fate.  Her father had died two years prior of angina.  her current heart pains, gripping, excruciating and oft paralyzing, would surely lead to the same death as her father.  since his death, she was rotated as the spinster-sister, to the homes of her 3 married sisters, each vexing stay adding to her melancholy and sick feelings.  a visit to the Meryton apothecary all but confirmed her demise in but a few short months.  as a woman, dependent upon others for her every need, Elizabeth felt more than loss.  she felt such deep despair that her 21 years had no success she could point to, no deep love she could credit.  parallel to her life's woes, were those of a pair, a brother and sister, Mr. Darcy and sister Georgiana, who had taken up refuge in Netherfield lodge.  not just refuge, but recluse.  Georgiana was dying of consumption.  her youth was literally wasting away from the disease.  and so, as Providence would allow, the three would find each other, and somehow, lift each other from the reality of their pains.  Elizabeth would find a higher path to take to her own end - she would be a comfort to the dying Georgiana.  but it would take a leap from social proprieties for Elizabeth to meet her new calling.  and she would take that leap and offer what she could to a ""sister"" in misery, while each approached her own life's end.  Darcy would allow it - unwillingly.  but death would come and take its toll.  and the two left would be grief stricken and retreat into their own heart's sorrow.  if only Darcy and Elizabeth could be a consolation to the other.  but that would take time, angry words, silence, mortification and the overwhelming feeling of isolation in each other's company.  oh, death, where is thy victory?  oh, death, where is thy sting?  maybe death's victory could be challenged.  maybe a heart's pain could be eased.  could there be a cure?  Darcy and Elizabeth might just seek another opinion.  oh, just ask the Love Doctor.  Heather Moll - great story - thank you! "

Both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet are prideful and prejudiced, indeed!They first meet at a masquerade ball at Pemberley. Ironically, both wearing masks, they are their truest, best version of themselves. Each feels an instant connection to the other, and they're eager to learn the identity of their partner.In a twist reminiscent of Cinderella, her uncle Gardiner whisks Elizabeth away before the midnight unmasking; he has been uncomfortable attending and fears repercussions if the exalted company realizes he's a mere tradesman. Darcy retains a scarf, an accessory of Elizabeth's costume, and is devastated at her disappearance. Elizabeth feels the same over the loss of this man she already feels half in love with.Darcy joins Bingley at Netherfield two months later. Still disturbed that he hasn't been able to find his ""Cleopatra,"" he's not in the mood to be pleased by anyone at the Meryton assembly - and thus makes his insulting comment about Elizabeth. Over time, he gradually changes his opinion of her but doesn't suspect she's the woman he's been seeking.Elizabeth initially believes she might learn her ""Marc Anthony's"" identity from Mr. Darcy, since he had hosted the masquerade ball. However, his insult and obvious haughtiness is too off-putting.The portrayal of Bennet family is softened in this imagining. It's a happy home. The shortcomings of the youngest sisters are mentioned but not dwelt upon. Mrs. Bennet is still a gossip and a bit flighty, but she cares deeply for all her children, and she and Mr. Bennet do love each other...if one knows how to spot the signs (as explained by Mr. Bennet to Elizabeth).I particularly admire the realistic view of love and marriage described in the story. (I've been happily married over 45 years, and I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Bennet's explanation!) The chemistry between Darcy and Elizabeth is firmly established from the beginning, and it's fun to anticipate how/when they will realize they've found their masquerade ball partner - and the Big Reveal does not disappoint.The characterizations are vivid, and the dialogue, for the most part, is excellent. However, I found the reflections/attitudes of Our Dear Couple regarding Antony vs Mr. Darcy and Cleopatra vs. Elizabeth to be occasionally convoluted and confusing, especially after they finally recognize each other. More disappointing is how much the characters' thoughts are described in detail. While some is necessary, so often it either tells the reader what is already apparent from the action OR has previously been narrated and doesn't warrant further repetition.I repeat, though, that I do love this storyline.There is some adult content near the book's end. "," I found this variation of Pride and Prejudice an intriguing idea. Darcy and Elizabeth behind a mask, falling in love at a romantic maskerade was untterly enchanting. I fell in love with the characters fairly quickly and found that I did not want their magical night to end. I also found that I was reading faster through the next part until they would meet again and I loved how they ended up realizing their true connection in the end.The only thing about this rendition is the steamy bedroom scene in detail at the very end. Needless to say, I gave the book a 5, which was still deserving, but I have always loved a clean book from beginning to end, which accomplishes the same ambiance and alluring romance without the use of risqué bedroom details. It was only the very last page which I’m grateful. I feel this variation was so good the final few bedroom scene details were not needed. The romantic climax had really already been won as Darcy wisked her into a bedroom, reminiscent of Cleopatras chambers. This was all that was really needed. I would have loved to share this book with others and my nieces had the last scene not been attached, (last page) What a beautiful romance. "," This could be a 5-star novel with some minor editing for anachronisms, grammar, misuse of words and filling in of the plot holes. As it stands, it’s rounded up to 4 stars. The author jumps around and ahead a bit too much to make the story coherent at times. It helps if the reader has a solid familiarity with P&P to fill in the missing details. That said, the story is interesting, romance abounds, dialogue sparkles, etc. A few more chapters to develop the characters and connect the gaps would have made this really memorable. Worth the read. "," Suddenly, a baritone voice called out to her, “Queen Cleopatra!”Elizabeth turned to face a Roman general.“General Marcus Antonius!” she exclaimed, and they laughed together, relishing the freedom to forget, if only for a night, that she was Miss Elizabeth Bennet of Longbourn, and he was Fitzwilliam Darcy, the master of Pemberley.The quote above sets up the story.  Elizabeth Bennet meets Fitzwilliam Darcy at a Masquerade Ball.  They are separated before the unmasking.  They had not been introduced by name.We all know they will eventually meet in Meryton.Will they recognize each other?What hints will be available to them?What if love strikes Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam?Will they still search for Cleopatra and Anthony?I have seen similar premises before, but this takes a different turn.  I think this is a first-time published author.  I will watch for more.4.5 Stars rounded up.The human face is, after all, nothing more nor less than a mask. ~ Agatha Christie "," Wow what an ending!! This story is so smart, very intriguing because you must proceed to find out what happens! How do they finals meet again! I love Fitzwilliam he is so human. His attitude is so true. "," I enjoyed this debut despite its unexplained highlights (I have public notes turned off).The cover is gorgeous but if Darcy and Elizabeth’s masks were like these they were idiots not to recognize each other.

Darcy had written to Mr. Bennet about why he was not returning to Netherfield right away not knowing what had happened to the Bennet family. When he returns from Java after rescuing his cousin, Richard, he heads to Netherfield to visit Bingley. He stops at Longbourn first and is shocked to find the Collins family in residence. One shock leads to another, and he and a bewildered Bingley decide to hunt down Wickham and search for the Bennets. Two years have passed since Darcy encountered Elizabeth at Pemberley, but he doesn't know that she has no idea why he didn't come to see her. Needless sway, Elizabeth is angry about this and the life she and her family are living since Mr. Bennet's death.

Of course, he and Elizabeth know that there is another reason for this gift of her family home without an entail. "," First off, I was confused by the title, the baby theme didn’t keep in until much later. Darcy disappeared and apparently the Bennets disappeared, and neither knew why. Darcy returns and quite by accident, finds Elizabeth. But she’s angry for reasons she doesn’t explain. So poor guy tries to help her family anyway but gets shot down a lot. I do understand her anger but he had reasons too. When Darcy found out about Wickham, why didn’t he just get him arrested? Instead he was ready to pay him and let him go again! It started well and ended well, with loop holes in between. Not enough romance and not enough baby either "," This story had tears in my eyes multiple times as my heart hurt for Elizabeth and Darcy as one thing after another, including their own stubbornness, kept them apart and at times left them with little hope. Thankfully, the story concludes with a happy ending for all the Bennet family.This is a well written book that I read in two nights because I couldn’t put it down. Juliana draws the reader in and keeps you in the world of the book. I will be adding this book to my favorites list for reading again in the future.

Between the 6 months at sea, helping Richard recover, and then waiting for a ship back to England, 2 years has passed.  Darcy goes to Longbourn but Mr Bennet is dead, and the family is missing. No one has any idea where they are.  He learns that Lydia married Wickham which caused Mr Bennet to have a heart attack, and Collins shows up with plans to allow them to live in 2 very small servants rooms. ( heartless SOB).  Eventually Darcy finds Elizabeth and her sisters hiding in Lambton from Wickham who wants his daughter. ( Lydia died in childbirth and he sent his daughter to an orphanage!)  From there it's a tale of hiding from Wickham, trying to help the women, and getting Elizabeth to marry him.  I did enjoy it and once again I found myself wanting Wickham to suffer. He didn't even remember his child's name!  It was Charlotte and he was calling her Margaret!! Scum.... Very interesting story that moved very quickly - nothing to drag it down & we were spared Caroline Bingley! "," The book opens with Darcy on a ship from India returning home for the first time in two years.  His cousin finally well after a grievous injury, Darcy is anxious to reestablish his relationship with Elizabeth Bennet.  But she is missing, her entire family has left Longbourn not long after Darcy's sailing for Java.He finds her by chance but she denied who she is, snaps at him to leave her in peace.  So we are presented to the difference between Me Darcy and Me Bingley: Darcy won't give up while Mr Bingle y , while miserable, maintained his separation from Miss Bennet.  Lizzy refuses to make things easy for her lover for her own reasons but how can she maintain her anger at how he left?  Read and see!  Recommended "," SPOILERSI can’t explain my rating without giving away surprises so don’t read further if you care.The plot doesn’t hang together for me. The Bennets have to leave the Meryton area to hide from Wickham. It’s incredibly important they not be found. So where do they end up? Lambton. There is no place on earth more likely he will go to sometime. Lizzy knows that. Huge flaw in the plot. And when the Gardiners were needed the uncle was away to the “north”. P&P and JAFF have made it clear he can’t be away from his wharehouses for long stretches of time so I don’t see how couldn’t have helped the BennetsDarcy is gone to India for at least a year to save the Colonel and when he comes back he doesn’t run to his ledgers and check how Pemberley is doing. He acts like he’s been away for just a couple of weeks.So basically I couldn’t lose myself into the story so I gave the story 3 stars. "

Fearing further action may be taken to damage Elizabeth’s reputation, he knows that marriage is the only form of protection he can offer her.Elizabeth and Darcy travel to London to begin the arrangements for a wedding that for all intents and purposes shouldn’t be taking place. In the midst of shopping for wedding clothes, sharing the news with family, and meeting Darcy’s noble relatives, Elizabeth is coming to learn more about who Darcy really is than she ever knew before. At the same time, Darcy is navigating the intricacies of realizing how wrong it is to interfere in the lives of others and how to deserve forgiveness from a friend.Though they act quickly to begin a new life together where one person is in love and the other now unsure of their feelings, Elizabeth and Darcy can’t stop one final attempt to keep them apart forever. But faith and love—and a little bit of luck—will play their part in determining whether there is a chance to pursue the happily ever after that both of them desperately want.

She has plans to one day visit England and take a tour of all the grand country estates which have featured in film adaptations, and often dreams of owning one. Christine lives in Ohio and is already at work on her next book."," This was a clever variation on the 'we must marry' theme. Darcy is in love, but Elizabeth is certainly not! But a tempestuous kiss between them is seen, and Elizabeth has little choice despite her initial furious refusal. If the scandal becomes public – and Lady Catherine will go to any lengths to make sure the Bennet name is blackened forever – she will be the ruination of her family. For the sake of her sisters, she reluctantly agrees.I loved the scene between Jane and Elizabeth, when Jane forces her sister to tell her the truth about this sudden engagement to Mr. Darcy. Jane counsels Elizabeth to not be so prejudiced, and in turn Elizabeth requests Jane give Bingley a second chance to prove himself deeply in love with her, despite his defection. The agreement between the two sisters, who are lifelong best friends, rings true.Darcy and Elizabeth have a goodly amount of face time together. Elizabeth doesn't show much wit, but very few JAFF authors do a good job on this. She does get to show her spirit and courage, however, so readers get to cheer her on several times.The by-play between Darcy and his two male cousins was delightful. Bingley finally shows signs of growing up. Anne de Bourgh surprises everybody. There is a minimum of Mr. Collins, which is more than enough, LOL. The villains get their just desserts – and in the case of Wickham, more than he bargained for, in a most inventive manner. "," You know we’ve wanted this to happen for ever so long.  Especially since the 2005 screen adaptation came out.  So now we have the kiss, and now we have to deal with the repercussions.  Brava Ms Combe.Why I Kissed You was a very entertaining read, the action started immediately and really hooked me in to reading it every chance I got.  I didn’t detect any grammatical errors, so well written in that regard.  And HEAs for all those deserving of them.  Lovely romantic HEAs.  And we get lots of Elizabeth and Darcy page time.  What a Hero.One quibble I had while reading this was that we know from the beginning that Lady Catherine is displeased in the extreme.  Of course. And she makes her threats loudly heard and plainly understood that she ‘knows how to act.’  I personally think that threat was enough to expect something bad was going to happen and would have been more suspenseful for the reader knowing the consequences were going to hit the fan at some point. Instead we’re reminded of it in the same words countless times when it could’ve been conveyed to the person with just ‘Darcy once again informed ______ of the circumstances regarding Lady C.’  Or words to that effect that changed up a bit and shortened!!  We readers already know.  Yes. The other shoe does drop, and it is spectacular.I recommend this to all JAFF fans.  This was my first Christine Combe read and won’t be my last. "," Notonly did you have the characters say whatI always want them to say you delivered some delicious poetic justice to some of the villians. It is a great thing our books came out at abput the same time or someone might be suspicious of me! I was 70% through your book when I had to devote myself to trying tp repair the poor punctuation in mine. Had I known the treat I was in for when I got back to it- wild horses etc. The End was also- sigh - terribly sweet.I did find a number of words that I'm not sure were quite what you meant. It is laughable for me to critcize something like that.  I would also say there were times I stopped wanting to read it. But the positive so far outweighs the negative that you need 5 stars ESPECIALLY FROM ME! "," A unique variation to be sure. I've not read another with the villain storylines this contains. There is angst however it does not turn into a soap opera. The bad guys / girls get their just desserts in a magnificent way.I will recommend this to friends "," I'm always amazed at how creative JAFF authors can be. Sometimes their ideas don't work but this little change seems plausible and the story worked well.  Good job! "," It read as if someone was telling you a long story.  Very few areas were it dragged. Mostly appreciated the differences between the original book and this. "," Mr,. Darcy  is  a very honorable man,  but more than  honor causes him to desire to  marry Miss  Elizabeth Bennet.  Seen by a servant, a spy of Lady Catherine  Debourghe,  Miss Elizabeth is turned out  of her cousin's home.  Not  willing to let this stand, and possibly  negatively impact  their sisters , they convince  their families they are marrying for love. Now,  of course , Lady Catherine  is not going to let this  go unchallenged. You'll  be appalled  at the lengths  to which she and her daughter are willing to stoop to  get their way.  I  enjoyed  reading about the noble relatives of  Mr. Darcy  and how addiment they proved to be in their support of their beloved nephew.  Mr. Bingley's  sister's  ill behavior is addressed  as we as the misconduct of  Mr. Wickham,  in a different way than  ever before. Sit back and enjoy the tale. "

She couldn’t speak up, or be her usual witty self. She was trapped among people who didn’t really like her for their own purposes…and her father put her there. I couldn’t understand why the author would have him do that as it changed her status in society, but wasn’t really a necessity as in other variations I’ve read. It just made him seem unnecessarily cruel and uncaring when she is supposedly his favorite daughter. Mr. Darcy was kind, and I liked that their relationship continued to develop, but it also added a clandestine feeling to their time together, especially when they were coming to the point, but couldn’t get permission yet. I like Lizzy better when she is sweet, kind, and able to be herself. "," Lady Catherine decides to take Anne to Tunbridge Wells. Since Mrs. Jenkinson is away, Lady C asks Elizabeth Bennet to be Anne's companion. Darcy, who has brought Georgiana to Rosings, discovers that not only was Miss Elizabeth unaware of his interest in her, she has no desire to marry him as she believes Wickham's complaints.It's a salutary lesson for Darcy. He accompanies his relatives to Tunbridge Wells, determined to change himself and her opinion of him.Elizabeth, meanwhile, is finding her job as companion to be difficult. Lady Catherine's officiousness is bad enough, but Anne's hostility seems impossible to overcome. To her surprise, Darcy is a much more pleasant companion on this trip, than he was at Rosings. She's puzzled and uncertain - which man is the real Fitzwilliam Darcy?Although the situation is set up differently, Lady Catherine's interference backfires on her in this story, just as it does in canon. ODC finally agree to wed, but their attempt to keep it under wraps for a week are doomed to failure. An unexpected visit by the Bennet family, and the reuniting of those star-crossed lovers Charles and Jane, still await them.The action wraps up, but at the very end we're reminded that the absent feather-headed Lydia has gone to Brighton. ""It was going to be a long summer,"" Elizabeth realizes with a wince.Book 1 is a stand-alone, but neatly segues into Bk 2, ""A True Likeness"". "," This is an interesting and engaging variation, although the circumstances are a little strange.  Mr. Bennett allows Elizabeth to take a trip to Tunbridge Wells with Lady Catherine, acting as Anne's companion.  Why Mr. Bennett agrees to this degradation for Elizabeth, we never find out, but just assume it's because he won't deny anything to Lady Catherine.  Darcy and Fitzwilliam accompany them, mostly because Darcy wants more time with Elizabeth, the woman he's in love with.Darcy displays more of his good qualities in this one, which means that Elizabeth goes much easier on him when she rejects his initial proposal to start a courtship.  Darcy is disappointed, but not ready to give up the fight.  He sticks around and learns to accept that some changes are in order if he wants a second chance.  Elizabeth is softened up with the help of Georgiana, Fitzwilliam, and Darcy's cousins Chuff and Honoria.The situation is strange because of Elizabeth's status as a companion, and also because she's not much of a companion since Anne DeBourgh doesn't like her.  Elizabeth always seems a little lost in this story, being caught between her companion status, and her true social level as a gentleman's daughter.  Nonetheless, the story progresses nicely up until late in the tale, when Mr. and Mrs Bennett show up unexpectedly in Tunbridge Wells, supposedly in pursuit of Mr. Bingley for Jane.  This is when the story jumps off the rails for me, and becomes a little ludicrous, and is why I deducted a star.The book is well written and well edited.  I recommend it. "," 4.5 rounded up to 5 starsElizabeth's courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate her, as all Pride and Prejudice fans are aware. When she reluctantly becomes Anne de Bourgh's companion in Mrs. Jenkinson's absence (never expecting that her father would allow it), she gets lots of opportunities to test her mettle. Lady Catherine is certainly an intimidating employer, and it's fun to read Elizabeth's struggle to fulfill her assigned role while staying true to herself.It's not only Lady C. that Elizabeth has to contend with. Anne is impervious to her charm - even seems resentful, no matter how much Elizabeth tries to please her. And Mr. Darcy is confusing. She expects that her current position in service would cause him to look down on her even more than he did previously, but he's actually more engaging in company with her than he was in Hertfordshire.The story begins in Kent, and Darcy is contemplating proposing marriage to Elizabeth Bennet but hasn't come to that point yet. Once he learns she will be working for his aunt, he welcomes the extra time this gives him to spend with her, recognizing that his lady love doesn't REALLY know him. So, how will things work out when he finally does approach her and suggest a courtship?It's a clever premise filled with potential, and Ms. Garrett really works it well. I love when Caroline Bingley gets the Lady C. treatment - how will SHE hold up under the Inquisition? The plot leads to a crowded climactic scene; it's not just the Bingleys who turn up unexpectedly.While this sets the table for Book 2, it absolutely works as a stand-alone -- everything here resolves with no cliffhanger. The writing flows beautifully, and the characters are believable extensions of Jane Austen's. I do doubt Lady C. would deign to receive or to even acknowledge the Bingleys since they are not landed gentry; however, that would eliminate a very entertaining part of the story.Content is clean. I definitely recommend it! "

Everything is resolved neatly. I almost dropped a star because I felt it could do with a bit more fleshing out, but 😅 really I did just read it for a third time. It's a great story when I need something with a good sense of hope and light and love. "," Another job well done from these authors. Well written and developed storyline leaving no one hanging and Wickham of course getting what he deserves in the end. "," Excellent story of a brave Elizabeth that helps the fifteen year old Georgiana Darcy to escape a now undesirable elopement with the ever evil, wicked Wickham. Abandoned in Ramsgate by her governess under Wickham's plan, Georgiana is convinced that Wickham loves her. Once he's tricked her into a north bound coach to Scotland, his true personality emerges and she sees him for what he really is: a scoundrel wanting her thirty thousand pound dowry. Stopped at the same inn as Elizabeth Bennet, she overhears Wickham's treachery towards Georgiana and decides to help her escape her fate. She remains behind at the inn while Georgiana takes her seat in the carriage of her aunt and uncle's friends, the Muirs. The innkeeper keep her protected, but she still has risked her reputation by staying at the inn without a real companion. Wickham figures out what happened with Georgiana and returns to the inn to confront Elizabeth. Fortunately, Darcy has come to find Elizabeth and stops Wickham from hurting her further. A duel is fought over Elizabeth, causing Wickham to surrender in front of the many people who witness his shameful behavior. To save Elizabeth's reputation, Darcy marries her in Scotland. Returning to the inn, they meet her father and Jane. Traveling on to Pemberley, they meet the Bingleys and Colonel Fitzwilliam. Wickham threatens Darcy, misunderstandings over his changed demeanor towards Elizabeth causes trouble, Caroline Bingley's interference into Darcy's affairs create more problems, and Bingley and the colonel vying for Jane's attention raise tension between Elizabeth and Darcy also. Mr. Bennet befriends Georgiana and her feelings for Wickham become clearer as Mr. Bennet encourages her to get rid of all her paintings and drawings of the man that betrayed her. He keeps three of these paintings for he feels that one day, her portraits will be famous. Unbeknownst to him, when Wickham using another name tries an elopement with another young girl, these paintings will exposed his perfidy and send him on a one way voyage to Australia. Happy that Wickham can no longer intrude in his life, Darcy settles into a very loving marriage with the young lady with the very fine eyes and loving heart who saved his beloved sister. "," Maybe because we start with Darcy frantically searching for Georgiana in Ramsgate and then on the way north the story has a big dose of Darcy being overprotective and swooping in to save Elizabeth even when swooping in might not be the most rational thing to do. Wonderful story! "," These two ladies have yet to disappoint me with their imaginative retellings. It doesn’t seem to matter how implausible the premise really is, they make it feel believable, and it’s always enjoyable.My favorite thing about this variation is the conversations between E&D, which they don’t skimp on. I like that even though this is a sort of “forced marriage” scenario, they come to it without the baggage of their original meeting (in other words, Elizabeth doesn’t hate Darcy, and he isn’t acting against his sense of duty). I also really like the path Georgiana took. "," Lizzy meets Georgiana as she is eloping with Wickham. Lizzy saves her from W but a freight train of unintended consequences is coming down the tracks. Good story. Has a number of scenes we rarely read in P&P variations. Second time I’ve read it. Thumbs up. "," This was a quick read (accomplished in a few uninterrupted hours) and I wish it would have been longer. This story was so diverting....the premise of the book was so different from any of the other vagaries that have been written and we all know there have been hundreds of those.  I have enjoyed many of Renata McMann's P&P variations that I couldn't resist getting this one. I am very glad I did.  Definitely an enjoyable read. I purposely have not written a review divulging the plot. The publisher's review should be enough. "," This was fun to read. The plot was well developed and interesting. I liked the disposition of Wickham very much. My favorite characters were Lydia and Mr Bennet, they certainly added to the story and I liked their interactions with those around them. There were a few grammatical errors but none of continuity and none that would stop me from reading this very enjoyable book again "

His gallantry and compassion as he escorts her back to Hertfordshire begins to unravel the many threads of her discontent with him. While her family heals from their loss, Darcy must search London for answers – answers that might bring justice, but might also just mark the end of his own hopes with Elizabeth. Is it true that nothing can be lost that love cannot find?  Read more","BRONZE IPPY AWARD WINNING AUTHORKaraLynne began writing horrible poetry as an angst filled youth. It was a means to express the exhilaration and devastation she felt every time her adolescent heart was newly in love with “the one” and then broken every other week. As her frontal lobe developed, she grew more discerning of both men and writing. She has been married to her own dreamboat of a best friend, Andrew, for almost 20 years. Together they have the migraine inducing responsibility of raising five children to not be dirt bags (fingers crossed), pick of up their socks (still a work in progress), not fight with each other (impossible task) and become generally good people (there’s hope). She loves escaping into a book, her feather babies (the regal hens of Cluckingham Palace), and laughter.She has written five books and participated in many anthologies including: Falling For Mr. Darcy; Bluebells in the Mourning; Haunting Mr. Darcy: A Spirited Courtship; Yours Forevermore, Darcy; BeSwitched; The Darcy Monologues; Rational Creatures; & Sun-Kissed: Effusions of Summer.Visit my Facebook page to stay in the loop:https://www.facebook.com/KaraLynneMackroryAuthor"," Fortunately for me I purchased this on a Friday evening, allowing me to stay up late reading and then finish it the following day when I didn't have to work. I literally couldn't put it down, and I want to commend the author on this sweet tale. I loved her first novel - indeed it ranked in my personal Top 5 of the Darcy/Elizabeth novels.  This second book will have to be inserted into the Top 6 I suppose!The reader is offered a unique twist to the story, with Darcy on the verge of proposing to Elizabeth when he comes upon her just after receiving some very distressing news from home. Darcy's comfort to Elizabeth and his ensuing offer to transport her home seem completely natural, and he is (fortunately) prevented from making the awful marriage proposal in Hunsford. Because of this very unfortunate turn of events, Darcy is able to see that Lizzy would not have accepted him had he proposed at that time, and is able to work at becoming a better man as he strives to make himself worthy of her love.Things I loved about this book:* There were some wonderfully romantic scenes - especially the ""first kiss"" in the field of bluebells. If Elizabeth wasn't still in mourning this would have made the perfect proposal setting, but then our novel would have ended too soon!* There are no sex scenes, as I DO NOT believe that our two favorite Austen characters would engage in this type of activity prior to marriage. Mackrory is one of those authors that proves you can have a simply wonderful and delicious romance scene without unnecessary vulgarity. (And not that I don't enjoy a good steamy scene, just not with these two characters!)* We are exposed to some of Mrs. Bennett's vulnerabilities and we get to see wonderful improvements in her as a result of Lydia's death.* The improvement in Mr. and Mrs. Bennett's relationship is a delight - and I ABSOLUTELY love the turn of events for them found in the prologue.  (Very clever!)* Georgiana's delightfully clever schemes to bring Darcy and Elizabeth together are so very amusing.  I enjoyed the way her character was written in this - she was still a bit shy, but certainly not insecure. Definitely a great character.* Mr. Bingley's independence of Darcy is satisfying to encounter.  I love that he was not just so blissfully easy-going, instead showing his ire to Darcy when it became clear that Darcy had misled him.  Bingley shows his mettle in this novel, and makes his own decision to come back to Hertfordshire to comfort the family in his time of mourning without informing Darcy.  Good for you Bingley!* I felt that Wickham's actions were believable and not TOO evil, meaning I never can quite buy the idea of him ""kidnapping"" Elizabeth as he is wont to do in other novels.  His fate at the end of the book is what he deserves.* It is a pleasure to see that out of tragedy good comes in the growth of the entire Bennett family, the Darcy's and Mr. Bingley.If there is one thing I became frustrated with as I was reading this novel, it was the misunderstanding between Elizabeth and Darcy after they both read the revelations in Lydia's diary. We know they are going to end up together eventually, but you just want to slap them both for their mistaken assumptions about one another. Having said that, however, I love the final outcome, of course.  Georgiana, as a strong, confident character, provides the appropriate interference in their misunderstanding. Elizabeth sends the appropriate signal to Darcy to let him know she still cares, and Darcy's impulsive horse ride to Longbourn from London is quite satisfying.All in all, this was a great read and would recommend this to any JAFF reader!  Thank you Mackrory - a job well done! "," I really enjoyed this idea! Who knew that Mr. Collins' could ever be right about something? ""The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this."" In this case, that was true.I hesitate to spoil much... **so beware reading more** but the death of one Bennet sister truly did cause a lot of good things to come about. Like the reconciliation of the Bennet parents. That was truly sweet. It made me smile to see them happy. I often see Elizabeth's mother portrayed as tasteless and stupid; I was glad when we got a reasonable explanation for her actions, and to see her become gentle and soft and loving again. It shows how a simple emotional misunderstanding can truly pull apart your relationships with people you love. I loved to see things blossom between her and her husband.This story was, what I think is called, an omniscient narrative? That we got insight to everyone's perspective and thoughts, not only Lizzy and Darcy. This was different for me, because I normally appreciate a little left to the imagination, but I did like the insight and experiencing the thoughts of characters we don't normally hear from. It was original.The romance between our favorite love birds was darling! It was interesting to see what would have happened if an urgent letter had come to Elizabeth right before Darcy had made his terrible proposal, causing them to race back to Longbourn, and having his suit halted by Elizabeth's family mourning. It was the best thing that might have happened, despite the sadness of the event. It really allowed Darcy to show his gentler, kinder side to Elizabeth, and helped her realize he was a gentleman worthy of her heart. It also helped HIM to realize his defects in character himself! And become exceedingly grateful he hadn't given her that bungled proposal at Kent after all.Despite the topic, this really wasn't a dull or morose novel, by any means. The Mr. Darcy pining is #real, and very satisfying. The situation, mingled with certain misunderstandings until the bitter end, is just angsty enough. It's a very thoughtful, well planned novel that shows how relationships can mend over mutual heartbreak, and how simple misunderstandings, without addressing the issue, can tear them apart. And all the one-sided and mutual pining a person can ask for.I thought all the characters really shined in this book. Georgiana has a significant role; we really get to see her come out of her shell and, very amusingly, help her brother along in his awkward attempts at courtship. Their sibling's bond was cute. We get a sweet and heart-melting view of the Bennet marriage that one does not normally see.My only reason to remove a star is that, at times, the language was too loose, and the slang was a bit too modern to be believable. Phrases like ""I guess,"" and other things. It was a little glaring at points, but not overwhelming. Along with this, the epilogue was a bit overkill. I don't think it was necessary to add all these different scenes to wrap up the perfectly satisfactory story. Considering all that, I'd personally give the novel a 4.5.A good, clean read with pining, angst, and lots of Darcy goodness. Would recommend. "," This author is a wonderful writer, and the story kept my interest.  At the Hunsford parsonage, before Darcy has a chance to present his awful proposal, Elizabeth receives a letter from Longbourn informing her that Lydia has died.  Elizabeth and Maria Lucas leave immediately on a public post carriage, and then encounter a problem during their rest stop in Bromley, because Mr Collins goofed up their tickets.  Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam are at the same rest stop, and offer to give them a ride to London.  Once in London, Darcy offers to let the two women stay at Darcy House, and then escort them to Longbourn.  Elizabeth, who has no very good opinion about Darcy, gradually starts to realize that he's not really such a bad guy.There's plenty of good points to this story.  Bingley is allowed to show a little backbone.  There's a nice little bit of mystery surrounding Lydia's death.  Mr and Mrs Bennett are profoundly affected by Lydia's death, but in a very good way.  There's a lot of romance.However, I needed to deduct stars for stupid behavior.  I love a good love story, but the romance crossed the line into ""sappy"" at every turn.  Way too much melodrama, extreme emotion, and pathos.  The reaction of both Elizabeth and Darcy to the news late in the story about Wickham was just plain stupid.  Darcy's behavior when he returns to London, thinking that Elizabeth won't have him, is just plain stupid and wrong.  I really have a problem with these knee-jerk reactions from characters who are supposed to be intelligent, and who we're supposed to admire.Of course everything works out nicely, and ODC have their HEA.  The book is well written and well edited.  If you can slog through the overly dramatic and corny content, I recommend it. "

Read more","A fan of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Anne Arden enjoys writing alternative 'what if' scenarios for our dear couple, Darcy and Elizabeth."," There is much to like in this variation, Darcy defends himself admirably after Elizabeth enumerates the reasons for her refusal of his proposal.Colonel Fitzwilliam expresses his interest in Elizabeth and the reasonableness of it to Darcy the next day!And though we can assume the news of her engagement to Darcy was sent to Kent through the Lucases, it was not specifically stated. Still, Lady Catherine's attempt to break it up was humorous.Then again, most of the above were not actually resolved. Colonel Fitzwilliam decides he should have noticed Darcy's interest and just gives up?Lady Catherine just accepts defeat in trying to break up Darcy's engagement? Attends but remains silent during the wedding? And Darcy wanted a London wedding?Many points seem either farfetched or underexplored.I'm other words, good but it had the potential to be better. "," This is just a very generic p&p variation. A whole lot of nothing takes place. Darcy proposes at Rosings; Elizabeth refuses. He explains then and there about his reasoning for interfering w Jane and Bingley's relationship and his history w Wickham then storms off before anything else can be said. Of course, E almost immediately realizes that she's in love with him and must apologize but the opportunity to speak privately never presents itself. This and that (very trivial, contrived events) get in the way until the very end wherein E just gestures w her head for D to follow her out into the hall so they can talk. Why in the name of all that is holy did she not just do that sooner?!?!Some angst was attempted w Col Fitzwilliam and then MrB but it's all wrapped up perfectly neatly with no repercussions whatsoever, LCdB makes her usual sojourn to Longbourn but is easily put in her place with a simple ""I'm gonna marry him anyway, you old bat!"" She even shows up at the wedding (which takes place in London a month after J&B's wedding becuz D decides their wedding needed to be a grand affair...what? Where exactly was his growth?) and you think maybe she's gonna pull something but she doesn't. Really, it's one big giant nothing burger.A lot of the early scenes were very reminiscent of the P&P movies, both 1995 and 2005, from the language to the descriptions.On the positive side, I didn't notice any grammatical errors and it was a very short, quick read. I read the whole thing in about an hour. "," I thought this was a good book and sometimes you just need a story to love.  I recommend it. "," Basically this book is just Darcy and Elizabeth arguing after the proposal and then being thwarted in any attempt to speak again until the end comes and everything is resolved in one conversation. It’s the most frustrating kind of variation, honestly, where contrived circumstances prevent a simple discussion (the whole conflict with Col Fitzwilliam falls under this category).Also as bad is that Lizzy apparently would have accepted his proposal if he hadn’t been so insulting? She calls him out for his selfish disdain for the feelings of others but she refers mostly to his insulting proposal, not his behavior toward everyone in Meryton. Worse, Darcy never seems to even understand his selfish disdain (or shame for his behavior) for the feelings of others, or the insults he gave during the proposal, until AFTER the engagement and his aunt’s poor behavior serves as a demonstration.Just a shallow, frustrating and disappointing story.

But the past intrudes upon her again, and Mr Darcy returns to her, handsome, wealthy, and widowed, and hiding many secrets beneath his solemn exterior. BUT IF TIME HAD ALTERED THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES, one thing remains: Mr Darcy still wishes to marry her, and this time, Elizabeth consents. At nearly twenty-nine it is inarguably a good prospect for her and indeed, not until they arrive at his vast estate does she realise how large a shadow his late wife will cast over their growing love. But the new Mrs Darcy’s courage will continue to rise despite the many attempts to intimidate her; and she vows to use whatever power she holds over the master of Pemberley to keep him.NAMELESS is a tale of the triumph of good over evil, of passion over prejudice, of loyalty over lies…and most of all, of enduring, unfailing love.This Pride and Prejudice sequel is perfect for fans of Jane Austen as well as those who love gothic masterpieces like Jane Eyre and Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca.  Read more","Discover more of the author’s books, see similar authors, read author blogs and more"," I'm thankful that the book summary prepared me for such a dark and sinister tale, in the style of Jane Eyre, where the story is brimming with despair and hardship, and the way forward in the story promises to be a long and bleak road.  What kept me going was knowing that this is a P&P variation, and no author worth their salt would leave the reader in despair.  This is an epic saga, with wonderful characters, both good and bad.  The bad ones are REALLY bad.  Fortunately, we're given an Elizabeth Bennett who is fabulous, and powerfully imbued with all of her best characteristics:  courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, sensibility, and tremendous inner strength.  Our Darcy character is swoon worthy, and it takes the entire story to discover just how great he is.The story is told in the first person, from the point of view of Elizabeth, a circumstance I don't usually like.  I've become accustomed to the JAFF variations wherein Darcy's pov is included, and I like that.  However, the first person works here because of the strong Elizabeth.  The Wickham/Lydia debacle results in the deaths of both Mr and Mrs Bennett, and Lydia is never found and assumed dead. Elizabeth and Jane go to live with the Gardiners until Uncle Gardiner dies.  Jane gets married, and Elizabeth finds a position as a companion to the Dowager Countess of Matlock, where she is treated poorly.  It's been eight years since Elizabeth has seen Darcy when he shows up to visit his aunt, and completely surprises Elizabeth with a proposal of marriage.  She finds out he's been a widower for a couple of months only, but she accepts him anyway.  They marry quickly, and Elizabeth immediately begins discovering that there's a lot of mystery surrounding the death of his first wife, and that there's a great deal of hostility and suspicion to overcome.My only criticism of the book is the author's attempts to incorporate text lifted directly from the original P&P.  I don't object to that, but it has to fit the circumstances, and often here it does not.  She throws in a lot of phrases, and even paragraphs, that really don't fit, and sound stilted and awkward where she inserts them.  Rather than try to force something to fit in, it would be better to just make up your own words.The book is powerfully written, and well edited.  I recommend it highly as an uplifting tale of the power of love and good over evil. "," I had not read the earlier reviews, so going in I was surprised... Ms Cooper even stole the opening line... One of the most famous in literature!  So the reader quickly knows what's coming, and it's not a bad mashup, but why would you want to do it!? I guess for all the folks out there who have sadly never read the original... The novel Rebecca was written by a superior novelist named Daphne Du Maurier back in 1938, and I was forced to read it in my English class, and like most people who have ever read it, I loved it... Was there ever a more dark and brooding character than Maxim DeWinter?!  Lucky for me, Mr Darcy came along years later in my life, and I fell in love again... In this one respect, I can give Ms Cooper kudos... Mr Darcy fit easily into the Maxim role, and an evil Anne DeBourge could be morphed into the Rebecca role, and Lady Catherine also, multiplied her appalling behavior into the Mrs Danvers character... But where, I think Ms Cooper missed the mark was in thinking that Elizabeth Bennet would be anything like the mousey and dull second Mrs Darcy... Our Lizzy became the heroine pretty quickly, and set the stage for the redemption of Darcy and the revelation of the evil Anne DeBourge... Georgiana and Jane and the Bingleys fit into the story well and Mr Wickham, rears his head... And the story moves quickly to it's dramatic conclusion... I was appalled that Ms Cooper would use that beautiful Darcy proposal from the book in an unseemly utterance from Anne, and some of the other dialogue from the book, I also felt ill-used... Though some of the romantic dialogue near the end between Lizzy and Darcy was quite beautiful... So, dear reader, I agree that it is a good book, but Du Maurier did it better.. "," This is an alternate P&P (+ Rebecca combination) where the story veers dramatically from the original but in so many good ways. Much darker than our beloved tale with murder, mayhem, scandals and mystery. Many of the usual characters are here but quite a few exit the story early on or are just mentioned with a few new additions and changed back stories. The characterizations are mostly true to the original however, if some a bit exaggerated beyond their original. There are so many challenges to ODC but the progression is realistic as opposed to some other variations I've read where it sometimes feels tedious as there is just hurdle after hurdle seemingly thrown in but not here. There are no unnecessary throw away side stories, they all tie to the whole very well.A lot of the story takes place before the book starts so there's a lot of time spent exploring and explaining what happened previously but there's enough current action to move things along. There is quite a number of intimate scenes but they are very clean and mainly fade to black moments. It's written PG-13 but there are a lot of mature themes going on; death, loss, murder, infidelity, prostitution, sexual preferences, suicide etc.As with most variations, there are a lot of original quotes included but they aren't forced as they sometimes can be, and are provided in different situations or by other characters making it interesting and surprising when they appear.I really, really enjoyed this one and will definitely read again as it's such a complex, well developed story. This isn't a quick, fluffy, comedic, romantic romp to the HEA, it's a darker, angst provoking but also deeply romantic in its way, earning of the HEA. Well done Ms. Cooper. "

I love this genre and having read tons of stories find that new themes are very welcome. So I read the introduction and was enjoying it. Unfortunately it needs more work. "," I like this author but some of her P&P stories are better than others. This pair of pre-Hunsford shorts is on the weaker side. In the first scenario, the timeline is rearranged a bit but the HEAs are easily reached.In the second, Elizabeth ""plays with fire"" and gets justifiably burned. I liked how the infamous World's Most Awful Proposal was shifted to an assembly, with the same ""I despise you"" result, but overall, Elizabeth seemed to show all the bad parts of her personality, which lessened my enjoyment of the story. There was no wit or kindness, just an ego-driven vengefulness that edged uncomfortably close to spite, a la Caroline Bingley.YMMV, but I don't think I'll be keeping this in my P&P collection. "," I loved Abounds with Gaieties, a very engaging and romantic tale, where a friendship develops between our beloved couple. It was a very agreeable read with a soft feel.In Her Spirits Rising to Playfulness, I could see the reasons behind Elizabeth's decision, but in some places I didn't enjoy her methods too much. But I enjoyed the story overall and loved the way it was resolved!A highly recommended read! "
